Brazil was inhabited by [[Indigenous Brazilian|numerous tribal nations]] prior to the landing of traveler [[Pedro &#xC1;lvares Cabral]] in 1500, who claimed the area for [[Portugal]]. Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808, when the capital of the [[Portuguese Empire|empire]] was [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro]] after French forces invaded Portugal. In 1815, it was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]. Its [[Brazilian Independence|independence]] was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the [[Empire of Brazil]], a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The country became a presidential republic in 1889, when a military ''coup d'&#xE9;tat'' [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|proclaimed the Republic]], although the bicameral legislature, now called [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]], dates back to the ratification of the first constitution in 1824. An authoritarian [[Brazilian military dictatorship|military junta]] had led the nation [[1964 Brazilian coup d'&#xE9;tat|from 1964]] until 1985. Brazil's current [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution]], formulated in 1988, defines it as a federal republic.&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazilian Federal Constitution |publisher=Presidency of the Republic |year=1988 |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constitui&#xE7;ao.htm |language=Portuguese |accessdate=3 June 2008}} {{cite web |title=Brazilian Federal Constitution |publisher=v-brazil.com |year=2007 |url=http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleI.html |quote=Unofficial translate |accessdate=3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation is composed of the union of the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], the 26 [[States of Brazil|states]], and the 5,570 [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Brazil}}
The word "Brazil" comes from [[brazilwood]], a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast.&lt;ref name="Fausto1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Boris Fausto|title=A Concise History of Brazil|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HJdaM325m8IC&amp;pg=PA9|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56526-4|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Portuguese, brazilwood is called ''pau-brasil'', with the word ''brasil'' commonly given the etymology "red like an ember", formed from Latin ''brasa'' ("ember") and the suffix ''-il'' (from ''-iculum'' or ''-ilium'').&lt;ref name="Vincent2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon S. Vincent. Ph.D.|title=Culture and Customs of Brazil|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HHobg0djRbEC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30495-8|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; As brazilwood produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil.&lt;ref name="Tucker2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard P.

The official Portuguese name of the land, in original Portuguese records, was the "Land of the Holy Cross" (''Terra da Santa Cruz''),&lt;ref name="Corporation1880"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bonnier Corporation|title=Popular Science|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hiQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA493|year=1880|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|page=493|issn=01617370}}&lt;/ref&gt; but European sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the "Land of Brazil" (''Terra do Brasil'') on account of the brazilwood trade.&lt;ref name="L&#xE9;ry1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean de L&#xE9;ry|title=History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil, Otherwise Called America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F8qqKoCSWVkC&amp;pg=PA242|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-91380-6|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official Portuguese name. Early sailors sometimes also called it the "Land of Parrots" (''Terra di Papaga'').&lt;ref name="Sokolow2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jayme A. Sokolow.

Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-0982-3|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Guarani language]], an official language of [[Paraguay]], Brazil is called "Pindorama". This was the name the indigenous population gave to the region, meaning "land of the palm trees".&lt;ref name="Herrera-Sobek2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Herrera-Sobek|title=Celebrating Latino Folklore|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lY-tY62V1FIC&amp;pg=PA155|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34340-7|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the Portuguese arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people,&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Robert M. "The History of Brazil" Palgrave Macmillan, 2003 ISBN 1403962553 page 32&lt;/ref&gt; mostly semi-nomadic who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. The indigenous population of Brazil was divided into large indigenous nations composed of several ethnic groups (e.g. the [[Tup&#xED; people|Tupis]], [[Guaran&#xED; people|Guaranis]], [[G&#xEA; peoples|G&#xEA;s]] and [[Arawak peoples|Arawaks]]). The Tup&#xED; people were subdivided into the [[Tupiniquim people|Tupiniquins]] and [[Tupinamb&#xE1;]]s, and there were also many subdivision of the other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ibidem, Levine 2003. Page 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the arrival of Europeans, the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture, language and moral beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto, Carlos "Os &#xCD;ndios antes do Brasil" ("The Indians before Brazil") {{pt icon}} Jorge Zahar Ed. 2000 ISBN 857110543x pages 45-46, 55 (last paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt; These wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water, with [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] rituals on [[POWs]].&lt;ref&gt;Gomes, Mercio P.

The land now called Brazil was claimed for the [[Portuguese Empire]] on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by [[Pedro &#xC1;lvares Cabral]].&lt;ref name="Boxer, p. 98"&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;98.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes, most of whom spoke languages of the [[Tupi&#x2013;Guarani]] family, and fought among themselves.&lt;ref name="Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;100"&gt;Boxer, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization was effectively begun in 1534, when King [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[John III of Portugal|Jo&#xE3;o&amp;nbsp;III]] of Portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous [[Captaincy Colonies of Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, pp.&amp;nbsp;100&#x2013;101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;27"&gt;Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic, and in 1549 the Portuguese king restructured them into the [[Governorate General of Brazil]], a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America.&lt;ref name="Skidmore, p.&amp;nbsp;27"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;101.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two centuries of colonization, Indigenous and Europeans groups lived in constant war, establishing [[opportunistic]] alliances in order to gain advantages against each other.&lt;ref&gt;Meuwese, Mark "Brothers in Arms, Partners in Trade: Dutch-Indigenous Alliances in the Atlantic World, 1595-1674" Koninklijke Brill NV 2012 ISBN 9789004210837 ''Chapter III''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf, Alida C.

===United Kingdom with Portugal===
{{Main|United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves}}
In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of [[continental Portugal]], causing [[John VI of Portugal|Prince Regent Jo&#xE3;o]], in the name of Queen [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]], to move the royal court from [[Lisbon]] to [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Brazil]].&lt;ref name="Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;213"&gt;Boxer, p.&amp;nbsp;213&lt;/ref&gt; There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local [[stock exchange]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Marta Barcellos &amp; Simone Azevedo; ''Hist&#xF3;rias do Mercado de Capitais no Brasil'' ("Financial Markets' Histories in Brazil") (Portuguese) Campus Elsevier 2011 ISBN 85-352-3994-4 Introduction (by Ney Carvalho), Intro. page xiv&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Banco do Brasil|National Bank]], and ended the monopoly of the colony trade with Portugal, opening it to other nations. In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the [[Portuguese conquest of French Guiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, p.&amp;nbsp;145.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of the [[Peninsular War]] in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent Jo&#xE3;o return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, in order to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for the past six years, the Crown established the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]], thus creating a [[pluricontinental]] transatlantic monarchic state.&lt;ref name="Mosher2008"/&gt; However such ploy didn't last long, since the leadership in Portugal resentful with the new status of its larger colony, continued to require the return of court to Lisbon (as postulated by the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]]), as well as groups of Brazilians, impatient for practical and real changes still demanded independence and a republic, as showed by the [[Pernambucan Revolt|1817 Pernambucan Revolt]].&lt;ref name="Mosher2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey C.

Tensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased, and the [[Portuguese Cortes]], guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony.&lt;ref&gt;Lustosa, pp.&amp;nbsp;117&#x2013;119&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|declaring the country's independence from Portugal]] on 7 September 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Lustosa, pp.&amp;nbsp;150&#x2013;153&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Prince Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil, with the regnal title of Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro&amp;nbsp;I]], resulting in the foundation of the [[Empire of Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianna, p.&amp;nbsp;418&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brazilian War of Independence]], which had already begun along this process, spread through northern, northeastern regions and in Cisplatina province.&lt;ref&gt;Di&#xE9;gues 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;168, 164, 178&lt;/ref&gt; With the last Portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 March 1824,&lt;ref&gt;Di&#xE9;gues 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;179&#x2013;180&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal officially recognized Brazil on 29 August 1825.&lt;ref&gt;Lustosa, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

As the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he became of age, a [[Regency (government)|regency]] was set up by the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalho 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power, during this period a series of localized rebellions took place, as the [[Cabanagem]], the [[Mal&#xEA; Revolt]], the [[Balaiada]], the [[Sabinada]], and the [[Ragamuffin War]], which emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power, coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar of a vast, slaveholding and newly independent [[nation state]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibidem Fausto 1999, Chapter 2, 2.1 to 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the [[Praieira revolt]], was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the [[Dom Pedro II#Early coronation|premature coronation of Pedro II]] in 1841.&lt;ref name="Ibidem Fausto 1999" /&gt;

During the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] was abandoned in 1850,&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Bethell|Bethell, Leslie]] "The Abolition of the Brazilian Slave Trade: Britain, Brazil and the Slave Trade" [[Cambridge University Press]] 1970, ''"Cambridge Latin American Studides"'', Chapters 9 to 12.

The foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related issues with the countries of the [[Southern Cone]] with which Brazil has borders.

Little by little, [[Rebellions and revolutions in Brazil#1st Republican period (1889-1930)|a cycle of general instability]] sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent, that by 1930 in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate [[Get&#xFA;lio Vargas]] supported by most of the military, led a [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|successful revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine; Robert M. &amp; Crocitti; John J.

Slowly however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that have not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford Burns 1993, Page 457&lt;/ref&gt; plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure, made an opening policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals [[Ernesto Geisel|Geisel]] and [[Golbery do Couto e Silva|Golbery]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibidem Fausto 1999, Chapter 6 "The military government and the transition to democracy (1964-1984)"&lt;/ref&gt; With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in 1979, Brazil began its slow return to democracy, which would be completed during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Ibidem Fausto 1999"&gt;Ibidem Fausto 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilians returned to power in 1985 when Jos&#xE9; Sarney assumed the presidency, becoming unpopular during his tenure due to his failure in controlling the economic crisis and hyperinflation inherited from the military regime.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;464&#x2013;465.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarney's unsuccessful government allowed the election in 1989 of the almost unknown [[Fernando Collor de Mello|Fernando Collor]], who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto (2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;465, 475.&lt;/ref&gt; Collor was succeeded by his Vice-President [[Itamar Franco]], who appointed [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] as Minister of Finance.

Despite its reputation as a ferocious freshwater fish, the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger. Biodiversity can contribute to [[agriculture]], livestock, forestry and fisheries extraction. However, almost all economically exploited species of plants, such as soybeans and coffee, or animals, such as chickens, are imported from other countries, and the economic use of native species still crawls. In the Brazilian GDP, the forest sector represents just over 1% and fishing 0.4%.

The Brazilian Federation is the "indissoluble union" of the States, the Municipalities and the Federal District.&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"/&gt; The Union, the states and the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the "spheres of government". The Federation is set on five fundamental principles:&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"/&gt; sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labor and freedom of enterprise, and political pluralism. The classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"/&gt; The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state/Federal District spheres.

All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected.&lt;ref name=embassy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/brazil_in_brief/political_institution.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725100724/http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/brazil_in_brief/political_institution.html |archivedate=25 July 2011 |title=Embassy of Brazil&amp;nbsp;&#x2014; Ottawa |quote=Political Institutions&amp;nbsp;&#x2014; The Executive |accessdate=19 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/government/brazil_government.html |title=City Mayors |quote=Brazil federal, state and local government |accessdate=19 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=JSTOR |quote=Brazilian Politics |jstor=196424)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt; For most of its democratic history, Brazil has had a multi-party system, proportional representation.

Together with several smaller parties, four political parties stand out: [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT), [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB), [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB) and [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] (DEM). Fifteen political parties are represented in Congress. It is common for politicians to switch parties, and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southtravels.com/america/brazil/government.html |title=Government &#x2013; Brazil |publisher=Southtravels.com |date=5 October 1988 |accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by authorities and agencies affiliated to the Executive.

The form of government is that of a democratic republic, with a presidential system.&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"/&gt; The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term,&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"/&gt; with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term.

===Law===
{{Main|Law of Brazil|Law enforcement in Brazil|Crime in Brazil}}

Brazilian law is based on [[Roman law|Roman]]-[[Germania|Germanic]]{{failed verification|date=October 2013}} traditions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/bra/en_bra-int-des-ordrjur.html "The Brazilian Legal System"], Organization of American States. Retrieved 17 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases.

[[File:Supremo Brasil.jpg|thumb|[[Supreme Federal Court of Brazil]] serves primarily as the Constitutional Court of the country.]]

The legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, which was promulgated on 5 October 1988, and is the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.&lt;ref&gt;Jos&#xE9; Afonso da Silva, ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo'' (Malheiros, 2004; ISBN 85-7420-559-1), p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007|04}}, there have been 53 amendments. States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, ''Curso de Direito Constitucional Positivo'', p.&amp;nbsp;592.&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities and the Federal District have "organic laws" ({{lang|pt|''leis org&#xE2;nicas''}}), which act in a similar way to constitutions.&lt;ref name="DeffentiBarral2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fabiano Deffenti|author2=Welber Oliveira Barral|title=Introduction to Brazilian Law|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1Ba2J5eD8wYC&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=6 June 2013|year=2011|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=978-90-411-2506-4|pages=20&#x2013;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms.&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"/&gt; Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]] allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"/&gt; There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts.&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"/&gt; The highest court is the [[Supreme Federal Court]].

This system has been criticized over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision-making. Lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve, and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Glugoski and Odete Medauar, "[http://www.usp.br/jorusp/arquivo/2003/jusp667/pag0304.htm Nossos direitos nas suas m&#xE3;os]," [[University of S&#xE3;o Paulo|USP]] Journal, 24&#x2013;30 November 2003.

Of these, the first three are affiliated to the federal authorities and the last two subordinate to the state governments. All police forces are the responsibility of the executive branch of any of the federal or estadual powers.&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"/&gt; The [[National Public Security Force]] also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/defesa-e-seguranca/2012/05/ordem-publica-e-prioridade-da-forca-nacional-de-seguranca |title=Ordem p&#xFA;blica &#xE9; prioridade da For&#xE7;a Nacional de Seguran&#xE7;a |publisher=Portal Brasil |date=2012-04-29 |accessdate=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country still has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide.

Brazil also has high levels of incarceration and the third largest prison population in the world (behind only [[China]] and the [[United States]]), with an estimated total of approximately 700,000 prisoners around the country (June 2014), an increase of about 300% compared to the index registered in 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2014/06/1465527-brasil-passa-a-russia-e-tem-a-terceira-maior-populacao-carceraria-do-mundo.shtml|title=Brasil passa a R&#xFA;ssia e tem a terceira maior popula&#xE7;&#xE3;o carcer&#xE1;ria do mundo|publisher=[[Folha de S.

{{See also|Regions of Brazil}}
Brazil is a federation composed of 26 [[Federated state|States]], one [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal district]] (which contains the capital city, [[Bras&#xED;lia]]) and [[Municipality|Municipalities]].&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"/&gt; States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"/&gt;

The states and the federal district may be grouped into regions: [[Northern Region, Brazil|Northern]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern]]. The Brazilian regions are merely geographical, not political or administrative divisions, and they do not have any specific form of government. Although defined by law, Brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes, and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects.

Municipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Union and state government.&lt;ref name="Constitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o"/&gt; Each has a mayor and an elected legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called ''[[comarca]]'' (county).

In terms of the 2011 [[Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report|Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index]] (TTCI), which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked 52nd in the world, 3rd among [[Latin American]] countries after [[Mexico]] and [[Costa Rica]], and 7th in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name=TTCI2011&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_TravelTourismCompetitiveness_Report_2011.pdf| author=Jennifer Blanke and Thea Chiesa, Editors |year = 2011 | title = Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report 2011 | publisher = [[World Economic Forum]], Geneva, Switzerland|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's competitive advantages are its natural resources, which ranked 1st on this criteria out of the 139 countries considered, and ranked 23rd for its cultural resources, due to its many [[World Heritage site]]s. The TTCI report notes Brazil's main weaknesses: its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped (ranked 116th), with the quality of roads ranking in 105th place; and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness (ranked 114th), due in part to high ticket taxes and airport charges, as well as high prices and high taxation.

According to the [[World Tourism Organization]] (WTO), international travel to Brazil accelerated in 2000, particularly during 2004 and 2005.

In Portugal, the reform was signed into law by the President on 21 July 2008 allowing for a 6-year adaptation period, during which both orthographies will co-exist.
