      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1930">Each year, in the solemnity of Corpus Christi, Berga celebrates 'La Patum'. Those who visit Berga on Tuesday and on Sunday of Corpus Christi or on Wednesday and on Saturday at the evening, could easily feel the festive atmosphere of 'La Patum'. The fire, the smoke and all people jumping, dancing and drinking will able you to participate in a celebration which, afther some changes, comes from the popular and religious theatre of the Middle Ages.

Joan Amades (a Catalan writer whose books talk about Catalan folklore) spend many pages on 'La Patum' in its book 'Costumari Catal&#xE0;' (Customs of Catalonia). According to Mr. Amades, "the celebration of Corpus Christi in Berga is an exception in general customs of our country because anywhere you will find the same celebration of Berga".

Mr. Amades notice that some ancient processional dances set up this celebration. Dances which have "magnificence and an enormous vitality" as he says. These dances -which leave the eucharistical sense behind- are the responsibles of 'La Patum' to be "a show of popular theatre which is something unique", Mr. Amades says. He says that he do not know anywhere in the country where the ancient dances are "a set so harmonic, so spectacular". He qualifies that these dances have to be seen "in the simplicity of the square theatre and the poor elements which people had when these performances were playied. A time of simplicity but a time of fulfillment". These remarks develop the conclusion of Mr. Amades: "La Patum is a document of archaleogical value in the sense of performances which had take part in the eucharistical celebration".

Manuel Riu (a Catalan writer) in 1955 considered La Patum "as a holy drama, mimic and rhythmical, which is developed outside in a square and which is a forerunner of the modern theatre".

Anthropologists, specialists in folklore and those who study different subjects have been interested in La Patum.</text>

He qualifies that these dances have to be seen "in the simplicity of the square theatre and the poor elements which people had when these performances were played. A time of simplicity but a time of fulfilment". These remarks confirm  Mr. Amades opinion that: "La Patum is a document of archaleogical value in the sense of performances which had taken part in the eucharistical celebration".

[[Manuel Riu]] (a Catalan writer) in 1955 considered La Patum "as a holy drama, mimic and rhythmical, which is developed outside in a square and which is a forerunner of the modern theatre".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2003">The '''Patum de Berga''' is celebrated each year, in the solemnity of [[Corpus Christi (feast)]], [[Berga]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Those who visit Berga on Thursday and on Sunday of Corpus Christi or on Wednesday and on Saturday evening, could easily feel the festive atmosphere of 'La Patum'. The fire, the smoke and everyone jumping up and down, dancing and drinking will enable you to participate in a celebration which, after a number of changes originates in the popular and religious theatre of the [[Middle Ages]].

Mr. Joan Amades, a Catalan writer, whose books talk about Catalan folklore devoted many pages to 'La Patum' in his book 'Costumari Catal&#xE0;' (Customs of Catalonia). According to Mr. Amades, "Nowhere else will you find a celebration of Corpus Christi similar to the one in Berga".  

Mr. Amades observes that some ancient processional dances set up this celebration. Dances which have "magnificence and an enormous vitality" he says.

The '''Patum de Berga''', or simply "'''La Patum'''", is a popular and traditional festival that is celebrated each year in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] city of [[Berga]] during the Solemnity of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]. It consists of several performances of mystical and symbolical figures that dance at the rhythm of a big drum and vivid music. The balls are marked for their solemnity and the use of fire and pyrotechnics.

It was declared by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] a ''Traditional Festival of National Interest'' in [[1983]], and was declared ''World Heritage'' by [[UNESCO]] on [[2005]].

Those who visit Berga on Thursday and on Sunday of Corpus Christi or on Wednesday and on Saturday evening, could easily feel the festive atmosphere of 'La Patum'. The fire, the smoke and everyone jumping up and down, dancing and drinking will enable you to participate in a celebration which, after a number of changes, originated in the popular and religious theatre of the [[Middle Ages]]. Giants, devils, and bizarre-looking monsters parade through many towns in Catalonia during Patum de Berga.

Mr. Joan Amades, a Catalan writer, whose books talk about Catalan folklore devoted many pages to 'La Patum' in his book 'Costumari Catal&#xE0;' (Customs of Catalonia). According to Mr. Amades, "Nowhere else will you find a celebration of Corpus Christi similar to the one in Berga".  

Mr. Amades observes that some ancient processional dances set up this celebration, dances which have "magnificence and an enormous vitality" he says. These dances -which leave the [[eucharist]]ic sense behind- are the core of 'La Patum' making it "a show of popular theatre which is something unique", says Mr. Amades. He says that he does not know anywhere else in the country where the ancient dances are "a set so harmonic, so spectacular". He qualifies that these dances have to be seen "in the simplicity of the square theatre and the poor elements which people had when these performances were played. A time of simplicity but a time of fulfilment". These remarks confirm  Mr. Amades opinion that: "La Patum is a document of archeological value in the sense of performances which had taken part in the eucharistic celebration."

The balls are marked for their solemnity and the use of fire and pyrotechnics.

It was declared by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] a ''Traditional Festival of National Interest'' in [[1983]], and was declared ''World Heritage'' by [[UNESCO]] on [[2005]].

* Turcs i Cavallets (Turks and Little Horses)
* Les Maces (The Maces)

* Els Nans Vells (The Old Dwarves)
* Els Gegants (The Giants)

* Els Plens (The "Plens")

==Origins and significance==

Those who visit Berga on Thursday and on Sunday of Corpus Christi or on Wednesday and on Saturday evening, could easily feel the festive atmosphere of 'La Patum'. The fire, the smoke and everyone jumping up and down, dancing and drinking will enable you to participate in a celebration which, after a number of changes, originated in the popular and religious theatre of the [[Middle Ages]]. Giants, devils, and bizarre-looking monsters parade through many towns in Catalonia during Patum de Berga.

Mr. Joan Amades, a Catalan writer, whose books talk about Catalan folklore devoted many pages to 'La Patum' in his book 'Costumari Catal&#xE0;' (Customs of Catalonia). According to Mr. Amades, "Nowhere else will you find a celebration of Corpus Christi similar to the one in Berga".  

Mr. Amades observes that some ancient processional dances set up this celebration, dances which have "magnificence and an enormous vitality" he says. These dances -which leave the [[eucharist]]ic sense behind- are the core of 'La Patum' making it "a show of popular theatre which is something unique", says Mr. Amades. He says that he does not know anywhere else in the country where the ancient dances are "a set so harmonic, so spectacular". He qualifies that these dances have to be seen "in the simplicity of the square theatre and the poor elements which people had when these performances were played. A time of simplicity but a time of fulfilment". These remarks confirm  Mr. Amades opinion that: "La Patum is a document of archeological value in the sense of performances which had taken part in the eucharistic celebration."

[[Manuel Riu]] (a Catalan writer) in 1955 considered La Patum "as a holy drama, mimic and rhythmical, which is developed outside in a square and which is a forerunner of the modern theatre".

Anthropologists and specialists in folklore have been interested in La Patum.

The '''Patum de Berga''', or simply "'''La Patum'''", is a popular and traditional festival that is celebrated each year in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] city of [[Berga]] during the Solemnity of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]. It consists of several performances of mystical and symbolical figures that dance at the rhythm of a big drum and vivid music. The balls are marked for their solemnity and the use of fire and pyrotechnics.

It was declared a ''Traditional Festival of National Interest'' by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] in 1983, and as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2005.

==Parades==

* El Tabal (The Drum)
* Turcs i Cavallets (Turks and Little Horses)
* Les Maces (The Maces)
* Les Guites (The Mules)

* Els Nans Vells (The Old Dwarves)
* Els Gegants (The Giants)

* Els Plens (The "Plens")

==Origins and significance==

Those who visit Berga on Thursday and on Sunday of Corpus Christi or on Wednesday and on Saturday evening, could easily feel the festive atmosphere of 'La Patum'. The fire, the smoke and everyone jumping up and down, dancing and drinking will enable you to participate in a celebration which, after a number of changes, originated in the popular and religious theatre of the [[Middle Ages]]. Giants, devils, and bizarre-looking monsters parade through many towns in Catalonia during Patum de Berga.

Mr. Joan Amades, a Catalan writer, whose books talk about Catalan folklore devoted many pages to 'La Patum' in his book 'Costumari Catal&#xE0;' (Customs of Catalonia). According to Mr. Amades, "Nowhere else will you find a celebration of Corpus Christi similar to the one in Berga".  

Mr. Amades observes that some ancient processional dances set up this celebration, dances which have "magnificence and an enormous vitality" he says. These dances -which leave the [[eucharist]]ic sense behind- are the core of 'La Patum' making it "a show of popular theatre which is something unique", says Mr. Amades. He says that he does not know anywhere else in the country where the ancient dances are "a set so harmonic, so spectacular". He qualifies that these dances have to be seen "in the simplicity of the square theatre and the poor elements which people had when these performances were played. A time of simplicity but a time of fulfilment". These remarks confirm  Mr. Amades opinion that: "La Patum is a document of archeological value in the sense of performances which had taken part in the eucharistic celebration."

[[Manuel Riu]] (a Catalan writer) in 1955 considered La Patum "as a holy drama, mimic and rhythmical, which is developed outside in a square and which is a forerunner of the modern theatre".

Anthropologists and specialists in folklore have been interested in La Patum.

The '''Patum de Berga''', or simply "'''La Patum'''", is a popular and traditional festival that is celebrated each year in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] city of [[Berga]] during the Solemnity of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]. It consists of several performances of mystical and symbolical figures that dance to the rhythm of a big drum and vivid music. The balls are marked for their solemnity and the use of fire and pyrotechnics.

It was declared a ''Traditional Festival of National Interest'' by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] in 1983, and as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2005.

* Els Plens (The "Plens")

==Origins and significance==

Those who visit Berga on Thursday and on Sunday of Corpus Christi or on Wednesday and on Saturday evening, could easily feel the festive atmosphere of 'La Patum'. The fire, the smoke and everyone jumping up and down, dancing and drinking will enable you to participate in a celebration which, after a number of changes, originated in the popular and religious theatre of the [[Middle Ages]]. Giants, devils, and bizarre-looking monsters parade through many towns in Catalonia during Patum de Berga.

Mr. [[Joan Amades]], a Catalan writer, whose books talk about Catalan folklore devoted many pages to 'La Patum' in his book 'Costumari Catal&#xE0;' (Customs of Catalonia). According to Mr. Amades, "Nowhere else will you find a celebration of Corpus Christi similar to the one in Berga".  

Mr. Amades observes that some ancient processional dances set up this celebration, dances which have "magnificence and an enormous vitality" he says. These dances -which leave the [[eucharist]]ic sense behind- are the core of 'La Patum' making it "a show of popular theatre which is something unique", says Mr. Amades. He says that he does not know anywhere else in the country where the ancient dances are "a set so harmonic, so spectacular". He qualifies that these dances have to be seen "in the simplicity of the square theatre and the poor elements which people had when these performances were played. A time of simplicity but a time of fulfilment". These remarks confirm  Mr. Amades opinion that: "La Patum is a document of archeological value in the sense of performances which had taken part in the eucharistic celebration."

[[Manuel Riu]] (a Catalan writer) in 1955 considered La Patum "as a holy drama, mimic and rhythmical, which is developed outside in a square and which is a forerunner of the modern theatre".

The '''Patum de Berga''', or simply "'''La Patum'''", is a popular and traditional festival that is celebrated each year in the [[Spain|Spanish]] city of [[Berga]] during the Solemnity of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]. It consists of several performances of mystical and symbolical figures that dance to the rhythm of a big drum and vivid music. The balls are marked for their solemnity and the use of fire and pyrotechnics.

It was declared a ''Traditional Festival of National Interest'' by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] in 1983, and as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2005.

==Origins and significance==

Those who visit Berga on Thursday and on Sunday of Corpus Christi or on Wednesday and on Saturday evening, could easily feel the festive atmosphere of 'La Patum'. The fire, the smoke and everyone jumping up and down, dancing and drinking will enable you to participate in a celebration which, after a number of changes, originated in the popular and religious theatre of the [[Middle Ages]]. Giants, devils, and bizarre-looking monsters parade through many towns in Catalonia during Patum de Berga.

Mr. [[Joan Amades]], a Catalan writer, whose books talk about Catalan folklore devoted many pages to 'La Patum' in his book 'Costumari Catal&#xE0;' (Customs of Catalonia). According to Mr. Amades, "Nowhere else will you find a celebration of Corpus Christi similar to the one in Berga".  

Mr. Amades observes that some ancient processional dances set up this celebration, dances which have "magnificence and an enormous vitality" he says. These dances -which leave the [[eucharist]]ic sense behind- are the core of 'La Patum' making it "a show of popular theatre which is something unique", says Mr. Amades. He says that he does not know anywhere else in the country where the ancient dances are "a set so harmonic, so spectacular". He qualifies that these dances have to be seen "in the simplicity of the square theatre and the poor elements which people had when these performances were played. A time of simplicity but a time of fulfilment". These remarks confirm  Mr. Amades opinion that: "La Patum is a document of archeological value in the sense of performances which had taken part in the eucharistic celebration."

[[Manuel Riu]] (a Catalan writer) in 1955 considered La Patum "as a holy drama, mimic and rhythmical, which is developed outside in a square and which is a forerunner of the modern theatre".

Anthropologists and specialists in folklore have been interested in La Patum.

The '''Patum de Berga''', or simply "'''La Patum'''", is a popular and traditional festival that is celebrated each year in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] city of [[Berga]] during [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]. It consists of a series of "dances" (''balls'') by townspeople dressed as mystical and symbolical figures, and accompanied either by the rhythm of a drum&#x2014;the ''tabal'', whose sound gives the festival its name&#x2014;or band music. The ''balls'' are marked by their solemnity and their ample use of fire and [[pyrotechnics]].

It was declared a ''Traditional Festival of National Interest'' by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] in 1983, and as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2005.

==Origins and significance==

"La Patum" has its origins in pre-Christian celebrations of the [[Summer solstice]], which were recycled and given new symbolism by the [[Catholic Church]] as part of its Corpus celebrations. In Berga, the earliest conserved reference to a Corpus procession is May 20, 1454{{ref}}. The festival evolved and incorporated more elements popular and religious theater in the [[Middle Ages]], leading to a unique combination of giants, devils, angels, moors, and other bizarre-looking characters. 

Despite the religious significance of Corpus Christi, and the Patum's descent from "[[Eucharist|eucharistic]] performances," in its present form it is rather a show of popular theater. It is unique in Catalonia

The festival evolved and incorporated more elements popular and religious theater in the [[Middle Ages]], leading to a unique combination of giants, devils, angels, moors, and other bizarre-looking characters. 

Despite the religious significance of Corpus Christi, and the Patum's descent from "[[Eucharist|eucharistic]] performances," in its present form it is rather a show of popular theater. It is unique in Catalonia

Anthropologists and specialists in folklore have been interested in La Patum.

The '''Patum de Berga''' ({{IPA-ca|p&#x259;&#x2C8;tum d&#x259; &#x2C8;&#x3B2;&#x25B;r&#x263;&#x259;}}), or simply '''La Patum''', is a popular and traditional festival that is celebrated each year in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] city of [[Berga]] during [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]. It consists of a series of "dances" (''balls'') by townspeople dressed as mystical and symbolical figures, and accompanied either by the rhythm of a drum&#x2014;the ''tabal'', whose sound gives the festival its name&#x2014;or band music. The ''balls'' are marked by their solemnity and their ample use of fire and [[pyrotechnics]].

It was declared a ''Traditional Festival of National Interest'' by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] in 1983, and as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2005.
