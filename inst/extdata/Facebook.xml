'''Facebook''' (formerly '''Thefacebook''')  is an online [[social networking service]] headquartered in [[Menlo Park, California]]. Its website was launched on February 4, 2004, by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] with his college roommates and fellow [[Harvard University]] students [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Dustin Moskovitz]] and [[Chris Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3#we-can-talk-about-that-after-i-get-all-the-basic-functionality-up-tomorrow-night-1 |title=At Last&amp;nbsp;&#x2013; The Full Story Of How Facebook Was Founded |work=Business Insider |first=Nicholas |last=Carlson |date=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the [[Ivy League]], and [[Stanford University]]. It gradually added support for students at various other universities and later to high-school students.  Since 2006, anyone who is at least 13 years old is allowed to become a registered user of the website, though the age requirement may be higher depending on applicable local laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.facebook.com/help/parents |title=Information For Parents and Educators |publisher= Facebook |accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name comes from a colloquialism for the directory given to it by American universities students.&lt;ref name="Growth"&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate =December 19, 2008 |url= http://venturebeat.com/2008/12/18/2008-growth-puts-facebook-in-better-position-to-make-money/ |title=2008 Growth Puts Facebook In Better Position to Make Money |work=VentureBeat |location =San Francisco |date=December 18, 2008 |author=Eldon, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After registering to use the site, users can create a [[user profile]], add other users as [[friending|"friends"]], exchange messages, post status updates and photos, share videos and receive notifications when others update their profiles. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends". Facebook had over [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|1.3 billion active users]] as of June 2014.&lt;ref name=CoInfo/&gt; Due to the large volume of data users submit to the service, Facebook has come under scrutiny for their privacy policies. Facebook, Inc. held its [[initial public offering]] in February 2012 and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching an original peak market capitalization of $104 billion. As of February 2015 Facebook reached a market capitalization of $212 Billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=facebook|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FB|website=Yahoo Finance|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Facebook|Timeline of Facebook}}

===2003&#x2013;2005: Thefacebook, Thiel investment and name change===
Zuckerberg wrote a program called Facemash on October 28, 2003 while attending [[Harvard University|Harvard]] as a [[sophomore]]. According to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', the site was comparable to [[Hot or Not]] and "used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person"&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=357292 |title=Hundreds Register for New Facebook Website |first=Alan J. |last=Tabak |date=February 9, 2004 |newspaper=The Harvard Crimson |location =Cambridge, MA |accessdate=November 7, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050403215543/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=357292 |archivedate=April 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To accomplish this, Zuckerberg [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]] into protected areas of Harvard's computer network and copied private dormitory [[Identity document|ID]] images. Harvard did not have a student "[[Facebook (directory)|Facebook]]" (a directory with photos and basic information) at the time, although individual houses had been issuing their own paper facebooks since the mid-1980s. Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Locke, Laura |url= http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1644040,00.html |title= The Future of Facebook |newspaper =Time |location =New York |date= July 17, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com"&gt;{{cite news |author= McGirt, Ellen |url= http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/open_features-hacker-dropout-ceo.html |title= Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg: Hacker. Dropout. CEO |work= Fast Company |location =New York |date=May 1, 2007 |accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was quickly forwarded to several campus group list-servers,{{clarify|date=October 2013}} but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating [[copyright]]s, and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.&lt;ref name="facemash survives"&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=February 5, 2009 |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=350143 |title= Facemash Creator Survives Ad Board |work=The Harvard Crimson |location =Cambridge, MA |date=November 19, 2003 |author=Kaplan, Katherine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an [[art history]] final. He uploaded 500 [[History of Rome|Augustan]] images to a website, and each image was featured with a corresponding comments section.&lt;ref name="fastcompany.com" /&gt; He shared the site with his classmates and people started sharing notes.

[[Image:Thefacebook.png|thumb|Original layout and name of Thefacebook, 2004.]]
The following semester, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website in January 2004. He said he was inspired by an editorial about the Facemash incident in ''The Harvard Crimson''.&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Claire"&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=February 5, 2009 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/ |title=The Battle for Facebook | newspaper=Rolling Stone | location = New York |date=June 28, 2008 |author=Hoffman, Claire |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080703220456/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/ |archivedate = July 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.&lt;ref name="skepticism"&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=April 30, 2008 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118539991204578084.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Judge Expresses Skepticism About Facebook Lawsuit |work=The Wall Street Journal | location = New York |date=July 25, 2007 |author=Seward, Zachary M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors ([[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]]) accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called [[ConnectU|HarvardConnection.com]]. They claimed he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.&lt;ref name="zuckerberghacked"&gt;{{Cite news |first= Nicolas |last=Carlson |title= In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account |date=March 5, 2010 |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3 |work=Business Insider |location= New York |accessdate =March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three complained to ''The Harvard Crimson'' and the newspaper began an investigation. They later filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg, subsequently settling in 2008&lt;ref name="nytb"&gt;{{Cite news |work=New York Times blog |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/judge-ends-facebooks-feud-with-connectu/index.html |date=June 28, 2008| title=Judge Ends Facebook's Feud With ConnectU |author=Stone, Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt; for 1.2 million [[shares]] (worth $300 million at Facebook's [[Initial public offering|IPO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Rushe, Dominic |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/feb/02/facebook-ipo-winklevoss-300m-fortune |title= Facebook IPO sees Winklevoss twins heading for $300m fortune |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London |date=February 2, 2012 |accessdate=April 20, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6KOXFUCYV|archivedate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership was initially restricted to students of [[Harvard College]]; within the first month, more than half the undergraduates at Harvard were registered on the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=March 7, 2008 |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/jul/25/media.newmedia |title= A brief history of Facebook |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=July 25, 2007 |author=Phillips, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eduardo Saverin (business aspects), Dustin Moskovitz (programmer), [[Andrew McCollum]] (graphic artist), and [[Chris Hughes]] joined Zuckerberg to help promote the website. In March 2004, Facebook expanded to the universities of [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Stanford]], and [[Yale]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{Cite press release |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |url=https://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?timeline |title= Company Timeline |publisher=Facebook |date= January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later opened to all [[Ivy League]] colleges, [[Boston University]], [[New York University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and gradually most universities in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 13, 2008 |url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/09/11/facebook-opens-up-cx_rr_0911facebook.html |title=Open Facebook |work=Forbes |location =New York |date= September 11, 2006 |author=Rosmarin, Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.tuftsdaily.com/2.5541/1.600318 |title= Online network created by Harvard students flourishes |work =[[The Tufts Daily]] |first = Lananh |last= Nguyen |date= April 12, 2004 |location= Medford, MA |accessdate=August 21, 2009 |archiveurl=

A high-school version of the site was launched in September 2005, which Zuckerberg called the next logical step.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Facebook is the go-to Web site for students looking to hook up |work=[[Dayton Daily News]] |location = Ohio |date=August 3, 2006 |author=Dempsey, Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt; (At the time, high-school networks required an invitation to join.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=May 13, 2011 |url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20080602081817/http://www.forbes.com/security/2007/01/25/myspace-security-identity-tech-security-cx_ll_0124myspaceage.html|title=Why MySpace Doesn't Card |work=Forbes |location =New York |date=January 25, 2007 |author=Lerer, Lisa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook also expanded membership eligibility to employees of several companies, including [[Apple Inc.]] and Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=March 9, 2008 |url= http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-09-11/facebook-opening-the-doors-wider |title= Facebook: Opening the Doors Wider |work= BusinessWeek |location=New York |date= September 12, 2006 |author=Lacy, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 26, 2006, Facebook was opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid [[email address]].&lt;ref name="welcome"&gt;{{cite web |first=Carolyn |last=Abram |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2210227130 |accessdate=March 8, 2008 |publisher=The Facebook Blog |title=Welcome to Facebook, everyone | date=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tos"&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |url= https://www.facebook.com/terms.php |title=Terms of Use |publisher=Facebook |date=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 business pages (pages which allowed companies to promote themselves and attract customers).

Facebook was announced as a member of [[The Alliance for Affordable Internet]] (A4AI) in October 2013, when the A4AI was launched. The A4AI is a coalition of public and private organisations that includes [[Google]], [[Intel]] and Microsoft. Led by [[Sir Tim Berners-Lee]], the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Google lead coalition for cheaper internet|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/google-berners-lee-alliance-broadband-africa?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2&amp;et_cid=51918&amp;et_rid=7107573&amp;Linkid=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theguardian.com%2ftechnology%2f2013%2foct%2f07%2fgoogle-berners-lee-alliance-broadband-africa|accessdate=October 8, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=October 7, 2013|author=Samuel Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 21, 2015, Facebook's algorithm is programmed to filter out false or misleading content, such as fake news stories and hoaxes, and will be supported by users who select the option to flag a story as "purposefully fake or deceitful news." According to Reuters, such content is "being spread like a wildfire" on the social media platform. Facebook maintained that "satirical" content, "intended to be humorous, or content that is clearly labeled as satire," will be taken into account and should not be intercepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=ALEXEI ORESKOVIC|title=Facebook clamps down on fake news stories|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/20/us-facebook-hoaxes-idUSKBN0KT2C820150120|accessdate=February 4, 2015|work=Reuters|date=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to BusinessWeek.com, banner advertisements on Facebook have generally received one-fifth the number of clicks compared to those on the Web as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate= July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2007/tc20071128_366355_page_2.htm |title= Facebook May Revamp Beacon |work=BusinessWeek |location =New York |date=November 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; although specific comparisons can reveal a much larger disparity. For example, while [[Google]] users click on the first advertisement for search results an average of 8% of the time (80,000 clicks for every one million searches),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.accuracast.com/seo-weekly/adwords-clickthrough.php |title= Google AdWords Click Through Rates Per Position |publisher= AccuraCast |date= October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook's users click on advertisements an average of 0.04% of the time (400 clicks for every one million pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url= http://valleywag.gawker.com/242234/facebook-consistently-the-worst-performing-site |title= Facebook 'consistently the worst performing site' |work= Gawker |date=March 7, 2007 |author=Denton, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of Facebook's low CTR has been attributed to younger users enabling [[ad blocking]] software and their adeptness at ignoring advertising messages, as well as the site's primary purpose being social communication rather than content viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.bizreport.com/2007/07/advertisers_disappointed_with_facebooks_ctr.html |title=Advertisers disappointed with Facebook's CTR |work= BizReport |date=July 16, 2007 |author=Leggatt, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to digital consultancy [[iStrategy Labs]] in mid-January 2014, three million fewer users aged between 13 and 17 years were present on Facebook's Social Advertising platform compared to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3 Million Teens Leave Facebook In 3 Years: The 2014 Facebook Demographic Report|url=http://istrategylabs.com/2014/01/3-million-teens-leave-facebook-in-3-years-the-2014-facebook-demographic-report/|work=iStategy Labs|publisher=iStategy Labs|accessdate=January 30, 2014|author=DJ Saul|date=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Time'' Writer and Reporter [[Christopher Matthews]] stated in the wake of the iStrategy Labs results:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The company released its own set of revenue data at the end of January 2014 and claimed: Revenues of US$2.59 billion were generated for the three months ending December 31, 2013; earnings per share were 31 cents; revenues of US$7.87 billion were made for the entirety of 2013; and Facebook's annual profit for 2013 was US$1.5 billion. During the same time, independent market research firm [[eMarketer]] released data in which Facebook accounted for 5.7 per cent of all global digital ad revenues in 2013 (Google's share was 32.4 per cent).&lt;ref name="Rush" /&gt; Revenue for the June 2014 quarter rose to $2.68 billion, an increase of 67 per cent over the second quarter of 2013.

All users outside of the US and Canada have a contract with Facebook's Irish subsidiary "Facebook Ireland Limited".

===Technical aspects===
The website's primary color is blue as Zuckerberg is [[Red&#x2013;green color blindness|red-green colorblind]], a realization that occurred after a test undertaken around 2007; he explained in 2010: "blue is the richest color for me&#x2014;I can see all of blue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Generation Why?|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/25/generation-why/?pagination=false|work=The New York Review of Books|publisher=NYREV, Inc|accessdate=February 15, 2014|author=Zadie Smith|date=November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LETTER FROM PALO ALTO: THE FACE OF FACEBOOK|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/09/20/100920fa_fact_vargas?currentPage=all|work=The New Yorker|publisher=Cond&#xE9; Nast|accessdate=February 15, 2014|author=Jose Antonio Vargas|date=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook is built in [[PHP]] which is compiled with [[HipHop for PHP]], a 'source code transformer' built by Facebook engineers that turns PHP into [[C++]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developer Blog - HipHop for PHP: Move Fast|url=https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2010/02/02/hiphop-for-php--move-fast/|work=Facebook Developers|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=November 11, 2013|author=Haiping Zhao|date=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deployment of HipHop reportedly reduced average CPU consumption on Facebook servers by 50%.&lt;ref name="arstechnica"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: a behind-the-scenes look at Facebook release engineering|url=http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/04/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-facebook-release-engineering.ars/1|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook is developed as one monolithic application. According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5&amp;nbsp;GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom [[BitTorrent]]-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes approximately 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process is zero downtime and new changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.&lt;ref name="arstechnica" /&gt;

Facebook used a combination platform based on [[HBase]] to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, new events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them into storage. The User Interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] behavior. These requests are written to a log file using [[Scribe (log server)|Scribe]] (developed by Facebook).&lt;ref name="high scalability"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/22/facebooks-new-realtime-analytics-system-hbase-to-process-20.html |title=Facebook's New Realtime Analytics System: HBase To Process 20 Billion Events Per Day |publisher=Highscalability.com |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out (thus the name). Ptail data is separated out into three streams so they can eventually be sent to their own clusters in different [[data center]]s (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article will generate a lot of impressions and news feed impressions which will cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a [[hash table]].&lt;ref name="high scalability" /&gt;

After this, data is output in PHP format (compiled with [[HipHop for PHP]]). The backend is written in [[Java]] and Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions are used to make the web pages display more quickly. The more and longer data is cached the less realtime it is. The data is then sent to [[MapReduce]] servers so it can be queried via Hive. This also serves as a backup plan as the data can be recovered from Hive. Raw logs are removed after a period of time.&lt;ref name="high scalability" /&gt;

On March 20, 2014 Facebook announced a new open source programming language called [[Hack (programming language)|Hack]]. Prior to public release, a large portion of Facebook was already running and "battle tested" using the new language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2014/03/facebook-hack/|title=Facebook Introduces 'Hack,' the Programming Language of the Future|date=March 20, 2014 | work=Wired|first=Cade|last=Metz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook uses the Momentum platform from [[Message Systems]] to deliver the enormous volume of emails it sends to its users every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2014/10/06/message-systems-email-provider/|title=The biggest email provider you've never heard of|date=October 6, 2014 | work=Fortune|first=Heather|last=Clancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===History===
On July 20, 2008, Facebook introduced "Facebook Beta", a significant redesign of its user interface on selected networks. The Mini-Feed and Wall were consolidated, profiles were separated into tabbed sections, and an effort was made to create a "cleaner" look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/idg/IDG_852573C4006938800025748D0064C292.html?ref=technology |title= Facebook Facelift Targets Aging Users and New Competitors |work= The New York Times |author=Havenstein, Heather |date= July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially giving users a choice to switch, Facebook began migrating all users to the new version starting in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.new.facebook.com/blog.php?post=30074837130 |title=Moving to the new Facebook |publisher=The Facebook Blog |accessdate=September 12, 2008 |author=Slee, Mark |date=September 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 2008, it was announced that Facebook was testing a simpler signup process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/11/facebook-testing-even-simpler-sign-up-closing-the-gap-with-myspace-in-the-us/ |title= Facebook Testing Even Simpler Sign Up; Closing The Gap With MySpace In The U.S |work= [[TechCrunch]] |date= December 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Notes 
:Facebook Notes was introduced on August 22, 2006, a blogging feature that allowed tags and embeddable images. Users were later able to import blogs from [[Xanga]], [[LiveJournal]], [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]], and other blogging services.&lt;ref name="welcome" /&gt;

;Chat
:Facebook Chat was added April 6, 2008.  It is a [[Comet (programming)|Comet]]-based&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=June 2, 2008 |url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=14218138919&amp;id=9445547199&amp;index=0|title=Facebook Chat |publisher=Facebook|date=May 14, 2008|author=Eugene }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[instant messaging]] application&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title = Announcement: Facebook Launches Facebook Chat | publisher=Facebook | date = April 6, 2008 | url = https://www.facebook.com/press/releases.php?p=27681 | accessdate =April 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows users to communicate with other Facebook users in a way similar in functionality to [[instant messaging]] software.

;Gifts

The format of individual user pages was revamped in late 2011 and became known as either a profile or personal timeline since that change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook Timeline: How to Enable It With One Click [PICS]|url=http://mashable.com/2011/12/15/facebook-timeline-how-to/|work=Mashable|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=February 15, 2014|author=Charlie White|date=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desktop &gt; HelpPages|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/281592001947683/|work=Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=February 15, 2014|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can create profiles with photos and images, lists of personal interests, contact information, memorable life events, and other personal information, such as employment status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing Timeline|url=https://www.facebook.com/about/timeline|work=Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=February 15, 2014|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can communicate with friends and other users through private or public messages, as well as a chat feature, and share content that includes website URLs, images, and video content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desktop Help|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/467610326601639|work=Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=February 15, 2014|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 Pew Internet and American Life study identified that between 20 and 30 percent of Facebook users are "power users" who frequently link, poke, post and tag themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why most Facebook users get more than they give|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/media-society/facebook-engagement-patterns/|work=Journalist's Resource|publisher=Harvard Kennedy School|accessdate=February 15, 2014|author=Margaret Weigel|date=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Pages (also called "Fan Pages" by users) to allow "users to interact and affiliate with businesses and organizations in the same way they interact with other Facebook user profiles". On November 6, 2007, more than 100,000 Facebook pages were launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Facebook Declares New Era for Advertising|url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2007/11/facebook_declar.html|accessdate=February 14, 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=November 6, 2007|author=Rob Hof}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2014, Facebook expanded the options for user's gender setting, adding a custom input field that allows users to choose from a wide range of gender identities.  Users can also set which set of gender-specific pronouns are used in reference to them throughout the site.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook Opens Up LGBTQ-Friendly Gender Identity And Pronoun Options|url=http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/facebook-gender-identity/?ncid=tcdaily|work=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL Inc|accessdate=February 15, 2014|author=Jordan Crook|date=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When you come to Facebook to connect with the people, causes, and organizations you care about, we want you to feel comfortable being your true, authentic self ...|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=567587973337709&amp;set=a.196865713743272.42938.105225179573993&amp;type=1&amp;stream_ref=10|work=Facebook Diversity on Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=February 15, 2014|date=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change occurs after Nepal's first openly gay politician [[Sunil Babu Pant]] sent a letter to Zuckerberg in early 2012 to request the addition of an "Other" gender option for Facebook users; Facebook's official statement on the issue: "People can already opt out of showing their sex on their profile. We're constantly innovating on our products and features and we welcome input from everyone as we explore ways to improve the Facebook experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Torsten H&#xF8;jer |url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/facebook-warned-over-third-gender-option300312 |title=Facebook warned over 'third gender' option |publisher=Gay Star News |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2009, Facebook introduced a "Usernames" feature, whereby pages can be linked with simpler [[Uniform resource locator|URLs]] such as &lt;code&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/facebook https://www.facebook.com/facebook]&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=20531316728 https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=20531316728]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=June 13, 2009 |url= http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=90316352130 |title=Coming Soon: Facebook Usernames |author=DiPersia, Blaise |date=June 9, 2009 |publisher=The Facebook Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many new [[smartphone]]s offer access to Facebook services through either their Web browsers or applications. An official Facebook application is available for the operating systems [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[webOS]], and [[Firefox OS]]. [[Nokia]] and [[BlackBerry (company)|Research In Motion]] both provide Facebook applications for their own mobile devices.  As of January 2015, 745 million active users access Facebook through mobile devices every day. {{Cite news| url=http://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-mobile-users-hit-new-highs-revenue-jumps/ | work=[[Cnet]] | title=Facebook mobile users hit new highs, revenue jumps | date=January 28, 2015 | accessdate=March 2, 2015 | author=Sherr, Ian}}

In May 2014, Facebook introduced a feature to allow users to ask for information not disclosed by other users on their profiles. If a user does not provide key information, such as location, hometown, or relationship status, other users can use a new 'ask' button to send a message asking about that item to the user in a single click.&lt;ref&gt;By Harrison Weber, Venture Beat.

===News Feed===
On September 6, 2006, [[News Feed (Facebook)|News Feed]] was announced, which appears on every user's homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays of the user's friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207967130 |title=Facebook Gets a Facelift|accessdate=February 11, 2008 |last=Sanghvi |first=Ruchi |date=September 6, 2006 |publisher=The Facebook Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.colnect.com/2010/03/facebook-celebrate-your-birthday-every.html |title=Facebook: Celebrate Your Birthday Every Day |publisher=Colnect blog |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url= http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2006/tc20060908_536553.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech |title=Facebook Learns from Its Fumble |work=BusinessWeek |location =New York |date=September 8, 2006 |author=Lacy, Sarah |authorlink= Sarah Lacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Since then, users have been able to control what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts, and newly added friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/ebusiness/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=192700574 |title=Facebook Founder Apologizes In Privacy Flap; Users Given More Control |work=[[InformationWeek]] | location = New York |date=September 8, 2006 |author=Gonsalves, Antone }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2010, Facebook was granted a patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=7669123 |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the same activity of another user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themelis-cuiper.com/22/us-patent-no-7669123.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110515155132/http://themelis-cuiper.com/22/us-patent-no-7669123.html |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |title=US Patent No. 7669123 |accessdate=March 9, 2010|publisher=Social Media|date=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patent may encourage Facebook to pursue action against websites that violate its patent, which may potentially include websites such as [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/02/26/facebook.patent/index.html |title= Facebook's news-feed patent could mean lawsuits |work=CNN |date= February 26, 2010 |accessdate =July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular applications on Facebook is the [[Facebook features#Photo and video uploads|Photos]] application, where users can upload albums and photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/24/facebook-launches-facebook-platform-they-are-the-anti-myspace/ |title=Facebook Launches Facebook Platform; They are the Anti-MySpace |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=May 24, 2007 |author=Arrington, Michael |authorlink=Michael Arrington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other [[image hosting service]]s such as [[Photobucket]] and [[Flickr]], which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60&amp;nbsp;photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200&amp;nbsp;photos per album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=87157517130 |title=Share More Memories with Larger Photo Albums |accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=7363 |title=Upload: 60 or 200 photos in the same album? |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=4947 |title=How can I add more than 60 photos to an album? |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2003726&amp;l=5f3c8&amp;id=1352160452 |title=Example of album from a regular user with a 200-photo limit |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy settings can be set for individual albums, limiting the groups of users that can see an album. For example, the privacy of an album can be set so that only the user's friends can see the album, while the privacy of another album can be set so that all Facebook users can see it. Another feature of the Photos application is the ability to "[[tag (metadata)|tag]]", or label, users in a photo. For instance, if a photo contains a user's friend, then the user can tag the friend in the photo. This sends a notification to the friend that they have been tagged, and provides them a link to see the photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 15, 2008|url=https://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=7|title=Photos |publisher=Facebook }}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2012, Facebook launched its App Center to its users. It will help the users in finding games and other applications with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/news/internet/Facebook-to-launch-App-Center/articleshow/13920641.cms | title=Facebook to launch App Center| date=June 8, 2012 | work=The Times Of India}}{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the launch of the App Center, Facebook has seen 150M monthly users with 2.4 times the installation of apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/14/facebook-says-it-now-has-235m-monthly-gamers-app-center-hits-150m-monthly-users/ |title=Facebook Says It Now Has 235M Monthly Gamers, App Center Hits 150M Monthly Visitors |publisher=TechCrunch |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sorting and display of stories in a user's News Feed is governed by the [[EdgeRank]] algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgerank.net/ |title=EdgeRank |publisher=EdgeRank |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Like button===
{{main|Like button}}
The like button is a social networking feature, allowing users to express their appreciation of content such as status updates, comments, photos, and advertisements. It is also a [[Facebook Platform#Social plugins|social plug-in of the Facebook Platform]]&amp;nbsp;&#x2013; launched on April 21, 2010&lt;ref name="1-billion-likes"&gt;{{cite news

Following the termination by the sheriff of Hampton, Virginia, US of employees who liked the Facebook page of an adversary, a federal appeals court in Virginia handed down a decision that the US Constitution protects the rights of US citizens to like any Facebook page of their choosing. US Circuit Judge William Traxler likened the practice to displaying a "political sign in one's front yard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rest assured, your Facebook likes are now free speech|url=http://www.techhive.com/article/2049028/rest-assured-your-facebook-likes-are-now-free-speech.html#tk.nl_thbest|work=TechHive|publisher=IDG Consumer &amp; SMB|accessdate=September 27, 2013|author=Caitlin McGarry|date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a lengthy period of calls from the public to include a dislike button on the Facebook interface, Zuckerberg explained in a Q&amp;A session on December 11, 2014, that his reticence was due to a concern about a tone of negativity on the platform&#x2014;whereby users could "shame" others&#x2014;and he offered the comment option for situations where people were unwilling to use the like function. However, he said, "We're [Facebook] thinking about it [dislike button] ... It's an interesting question," and said that he likes the idea of Facebook users being able to express a greater variety of emotions.&lt;ref name="Sam" /&gt;

===Following===
On September 14, 2011, Facebook added the ability for users to provide a "Subscribe" button on their page, which allows users to subscribe to public postings by the user without needing to add them as a friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meghan Peters|url=http://mashable.com/2011/09/15/facebook-subscribe-users/ |title=Facebook Subscribe Button: What It Means for Each Type of User |publisher=Mashable.com |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction, Facebook also introduced a system in February 2012 to verify the identity of certain accounts. Unlike a similar system used by Twitter, verified accounts do not display a special verification badge, but are given a higher priority in a user's "Subscription Suggestions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 3, 2012|url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/15/facebook-verified-accounts-alternate-names/|title= Facebook Launches Verified Accounts and Pseudonyms|publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, Facebook announced that due to user confusion surrounding its function, the Subscribe button would be re-labeled as a "Follow" button{{emdash}}making it more similar to other social networks with similar functions.&lt;ref name="verge-fbfollow"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook snubs 'Subscribe' button in favor of Twitter-esque 'Follow' on all profile pages|url=http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/5/3731986/facebook-like-follow|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with Myspace===
The media often compares Facebook to [[Myspace]], but one significant difference between the two Web sites is the level of customization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=March 8, 2008 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/technology/25social.html |title=Facebook Expands Into MySpace's Territory |work=The New York Times |author=Stone, Brad |date=May 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference is Facebook's requirement that users give their true identity, a demand that MySpace does not make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=September 10, 2010 |url=http://mobilitytoday.com/news/009500/facebook_connect_mt |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101024033731/http://mobilitytoday.com/news/009500/facebook_connect_mt |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |title=Facebook Connect fully integrated into Mobility Today |publisher=Mobility Today Fitness |date=May 7, 2009 |author=Ciccone, David }}&lt;/ref&gt; MySpace allows users to decorate their profiles using [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), while Facebook allows only [[plain text]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,134635-c,categories/article.html |title=Is Facebook the New MySpace? |work=[[PC World]] |location =San Francisco |date=July 24, 2007| author=Sullivan, Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has a number of features with which users may interact.

In July 2007, Facebook began allowing users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas the Wall was previously limited to textual content only.&lt;ref name="off" /&gt;

===Privacy===
Facebook enables users to choose their own privacy settings and choose who can see specific parts of their profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 13, 2009 |url=https://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=search |title=Search Privacy |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is free to its users and generates revenue from advertising, such as [[Web banner|banner ads]].&lt;ref name="tc"&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=March 9, 2008 |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6066533.html |title=Facebook goes corporate |work=[[ZDNet]] News |date=April 28, 2006 |author=Barton, Zoe |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080526001748/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6066533.html |archivedate = May 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook requires a user's name and profile picture (if applicable) to be accessible by everyone.

On November 6, 2007, Facebook launched [[Facebook Beacon]], which was a part of Facebook's advertisement system until it was discontinued in 2009.  Its purpose was to allow targeted advertisements and allowing users to share their activities with their friends.  

In 2010, Facebook's security team began expanding its efforts to reduce the risks to users' [[privacy]],&lt;ref name="revealed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revealed: Which social networks pose the biggest risk? | url=http://www.sophos.com/blogs/gc/g/2010/02/01/revealed-social-networks-pose-biggest-risk/ |publisher=[[Sophos]]|last=Cluley|first=Graham|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Criticism of Facebook#Privacy concerns|privacy concerns]] remain.&lt;ref name="liebertpub1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2012.0323 |title = Who Commits Virtual Identity Suicide?

Since 2010, among other social media services, the [[National Security Agency]] has been taking publicly-posted profile information from users Facebook profiles to discover who they interact with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/30/us/nsa-social-networks/index.html?hpt=ibu_c2 |title=NSA mines Facebook, including Americans' profiles|first1=David |last1=Simpson |first2=Pamela |last2=Brown |work=cnn.com |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 2011, Facebook settled [[Federal Trade Commission]] charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=November 29, 2011|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/11/privacysettlement.shtm|title=Facebook Settles FTC Charges That It Deceived Consumers By Failing To Keep Privacy Promises|work=[[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]]|date=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013 [[High-Tech Bridge]] published a study showing that links included in Facebook messaging service messages were being accessed by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.htbridge.com/news/social_networks_can_robots_violate_user_privacy.html |title=Social networks: can robots violate user privacy?|date=August 27, 2013|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facebook Bug Bounty Program===
On July 29, 2011, Facebook announced its Bug Bounty Program in which security researchers will be paid a minimum of $500 for reporting security holes on Facebook website. Facebook's [https://facebook.com/whitehat Whitehat] page for security researchers says: "If you give us a reasonable time to respond to your report before making any information public and make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service during your research, we will not bring any lawsuit against you or ask law enforcement to investigate you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://facebook.com/whitehat |title=Facebook |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2389460,00.asp|title=Facebook Offers $500 Bounty for Reporting Bugs: Why So Cheap|publisher=PC Magazine|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Facebook t-shirt with whitehat debit card for Hackers.jpg|thumb|A Facebook "White Hat" debit card, given to researchers who report security bugs]]

Facebook started paying researchers who find and report security bugs by issuing them custom branded "White Hat" debit cards that can be reloaded with funds each time the researchers discover new flaws. "Researchers who find bugs and security improvements are rare, and we value them and have to find ways to reward them," Ryan McGeehan, former manager of Facebook's security response team, told CNET in an interview.

Writers for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' found in 2010 that Facebook apps were transmitting identifying information to "dozens of advertising and Internet tracking companies". The apps used an [[HTTP referrer]] which exposed the user's identity and sometimes their friends'.

=== Electricity usage ===
On April 21, 2011, [[Greenpeace]] released a report showing that of the top ten big brands in cloud computing, Facebook relied the most on coal for electricity for its data centers. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase. [[Phil Radford]] of Greenpeace said "we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today."&lt;ref name="Dirty Data Report Card"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/Cool%20IT/dirty-data-report-greenpeace.pdf|title=Dirty Data Report Card|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Thursday, December 15, 2011, Greenpeace and Facebook announced together that Facebook would shift to use clean and renewable energy to power its own operations. Marcy Scott Lynn, of Facebook's sustainability program, said it looked forward "to a day when our primary energy sources are clean and renewable" and that the company is "working with Greenpeace and others to help bring that day closer."&lt;ref name="Facebook and Greenpeace Settle Clean Energy Feud"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Techcrunch]] |url= http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/15/facebook-greenpeace-settle-clean-energy-feud-after-two-year-campaign/ |title= Facebook and Greenpeace settle Clean Energy Feud |accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Facebook Commits to Clean Energy Future"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/media-center/news-releases/Facebook-Commits-to-Clean-Energy-Future/ |title= Facebook Commits to Clean Energy Future |accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google===
In May 2011 emails were sent to journalists and bloggers making critical allegations about [[Google's privacy policies]]; however it was later discovered that [[Public relations|PR]] giant [[Burson-Marsteller]] was paid for the emails by Facebook  .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://money.cnn.com/2011/05/12/technology/facebook_google/index.htm |title= Facebook vs. Google fight turns nasty |work=CNN Money |date =May 12, 2011 |first=Julianne |last=Pepitone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Users violating minimum age requirements ===
A 2011 study in the online journal ''[[First Monday]]'', examines how parents consistently enable children as young as 10 years old to sign up for accounts, directly violating Facebook's policy banning young visitors. This policy is in compliance with a United States law, the 1998 [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]], which requires minors aged 13 or younger to gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites. In other jurisdictions where a similar law sets a lower minimum age, Facebook enforces the lower age. Of the 1,007 households surveyed for the study, 76% of parents reported that their child joined Facebook when they were younger than 13, the minimum age in the site's terms of service. The study also reported that Facebook removes roughly 20,000 users each day for violating its minimum age policy. The study's authors also note, "Indeed, Facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join." The findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of United States federal law, but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not Facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors. Only 53% of parents said they were aware that Facebook has a minimum signup age; 35% of these parents believe that the minimum age is merely a recommendation, or thought the signup age was 16 or 18, and not 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/education/parents-children-facebook-privacy-age/ |title = Why Parents Help Their Children Lie to Facebook About Age: Unintended Consequences of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, several Facebook users in [[Bangalore]], India reported that their accounts had been hacked and their profile pictures replaced with pornographic images. For more than a week, users' news feeds were spammed with pornographic, violent and sexual content, and it was reported that more than 200,000 accounts were affected.

Users are not supposed to have the ability to post material to the Facebook Walls of other users unless they are approved friends of those users that they have posted material to. To prove that he was telling the truth, Shreateh posted material to Sarah Goodin's wall, a friend of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Following this, Shreateh contacted Facebook's security team with the proof that his bug was real, explaining in detail what was going on. Facebook has a bounty program in which it compensates people a $500 USD fee for reporting bugs instead of using them to their advantage or selling them on the black market. However, it was reported that instead of fixing the bug and paying Shreateh the fee, Facebook originally told him that "this was not a bug" and dismissed him. Shreateh then tried a second time to inform Facebook, but they dismissed him yet again. On the third try, Shreateh used the bug to post a message to Mark Zuckerberg's Wall, stating "Sorry for breaking your privacy ... but a couple of days ago, I found a serious Facebook exploit" and that Facebook's security team was not taking him seriously. Within minutes, a security engineer contacted Shreateh, questioned him on how he performed the move and ultimately acknowledged that it was a bug in the system. Facebook temporarily suspended Shreateh's account and fixed the bug after several days. Facebook refused to pay out the bounty to Shreateh, stating that by posting to Zuckerberg's account, Shreateh had violated one of their [[terms of service]] policies and therefore "could not be paid." Facebook also noted that in Shreateh's initial reports, he had failed to provide technical details for Facebook to act on the bug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bort |first=Julie |url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/researcher-facebook-ignored-bug-found-143418388.html |title=Researcher: Facebook Ignored the Bug I Found Until I Used It to Hack Zuckerberg - Yahoo!

On August 22, 2013, [[Yahoo News]] reported that [[Marc Maiffret]], a chief technology officer of the [[Cyber security standards|cybersecurity]] firm [[BeyondTrust]], is prompting [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]] to support in raising a $10,000 reward for Khalil Shreateh. On August 20, Maiffret stated that he had already raised $9,000 in his efforts, including the $2,000 he himself contributed. He and other hackers alike have denounced Facebook for refusing Shreateh compensation. Stated Maiffret, "He is sitting there in Palestine doing this research on a five-year-old laptop that looks like it is half broken. It's something that might help him out in a big way." Facebook representatives have since responded, "We will not change our practice of refusing to pay rewards to researchers who have tested vulnerabilities against real users." Facebook representatives also claimed they'd paid out over $1 million to individuals who have discovered bugs in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reuters&amp;nbsp;&#x2013;&amp;nbsp;Tue, August 20, 2013 5:03 PM EDT |url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/hacker-exposed-facebook-bug-reward-210333258.html |title=Hacker who exposed Facebook bug to get reward from unexpected source - Yahoo!

=== Users quitting ===
A 2013 study examined the reasons users eventually quit the site. It found the most common reasons were privacy concerns (48%), general dissatisfaction with Facebook (14%), negative aspects regarding Facebook friends (13%) and the feeling of getting addicted to Facebook (6%). Facebook quitters were found to be more concerned about privacy, more addicted to the Internet and more conscientious.&lt;ref name="liebertpub1" /&gt;

=== iPhone 'Paper' app ===
Following the release of the Facebook [[iPhone app]] "Paper" at the beginning of February 2014, developer company [[FiftyThree, Inc.|FiftyThree]] sent a correspondence to the social media company regarding its own app, also entitled Paper and trademarked in 2012, asking Facebook to cease using an app name that they consider their own. In response, Facebook stated that it will continue to use the Paper title but conceded that it should have informed FiftyThree at an earlier point in time. FiftyThree articulated its desired outcome in a blog post: "There's a simple fix here. We think Facebook can apply the same degree of thought they put into the app into building a brand name of their own. An app about stories shouldn't start with someone else's story. Facebook should stop using our brand name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook's New Storytelling App 'Paper' Lands In The App Store|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/264972/facebooks-new-storytelling-app-paper-lands-app-store/|work=Cult of Mac|publisher=Cul

=== User influence experiments ===

Academic and Facebook researchers have collaborated to test if the messages people see on Facebook can influence their behavior. For instance, in "A 61-Million-Person Experiment in Social Influence And Political Mobilization," during the 2010 elections, Facebook users were given the opportunity to "tell your friends you voted" by clicking on an "I voted" button. Users were 2% more likely to click the button if it was associated with friends who had already voted.&lt;ref name="bond20146mp"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Robert M. Bond, Christopher J.

Much more controversially, a 2014 study of "Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks" manipulated the balance of positive and negative messages seen by 689,000 Facebook users.&lt;ref name="guardian2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds|title=Facebook reveals news feed experiment to control emotions|accessdate=June 30, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|year=2014|author=Robert Booth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that they had found "some of the first experimental evidence to support the controversial claims that emotions can spread throughout a network, [though] the effect sizes from the manipulations are small." &lt;ref name="pnas2014"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Adam D. I. Kramer, Jamie E. Guillory. Jeffrey T. Hancock|title=Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| year=2014| volume=111| issue=24| pages=8788&#x2013;8790| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full| doi=10.1073/pnas.1320040111| pmid=24889601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the "I voted" study, which had presumptively beneficial ends and raised few concerns, this study was criticized for both its ethics and methods/claims. As controversy about the study grew, Adam Kramer, a lead author of both studies and member of the Facebook data team, defended the work in a [https://www.facebook.com/akramer/posts/10152987150867796 Facebook update]. A few days later, Sheryl Sandburg, Facebook's COO, made a statement while traveling abroad. While at an Indian Chambers of Commerce event in New Delhi she stated that "This was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products, and that was what it was. It was poorly communicated and for that communication we apologize. We never meant to upset you." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/07/02/technology/social/facebook-apology/index.html?iid=TL_Popular|title=Facebook still won't say 'sorry' for mind games experiment |accessdate=July 3, 2014|publisher=[[CNNMoney]]|year=2014|author=David Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, on July 3, 2014, [[USA Today]] reported that the privacy watchdog group [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC) had filed a formal complaint with the Federal Trade claiming that Facebook had broken the law when it conducted the study on the emotions of its users without their knowledge or consent. In its complaint the EPIC alleged that Facebook had deceived it users by secretly conducting a psychological experiment on their emotions: "At the time of the experiment, Facebook did not state in the Data Use Policy that user data would be used for research purposes. Facebook also failed to inform users that their personal information would be shared with researchers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guynn|first1=Jessica|title=Privacy watchdog files complaint over Facebook study|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/07/03/facebook-emotion-study-complaint-epic/12157471/|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=July 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the ethical concerns, other scholars criticized the methods and reporting of the study's findings. John Grohol, writing at PsycCentral, argued that despite its title and claims of "[[emotional contagion]]," this study did not look at emotions at all. Instead, its authors used an application (called "Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count" or LIWC 2007) that simply counted positive and negative words in order to infer users' sentiments. He wrote that a shortcoming of the LIWC tool is that it does not understand negations. Hence, the tweet "I am not happy" would be scored as positive: "Since the LIWC 2007 ignores these subtle realities of informal human communication, so do the researchers." Grohol concluded that given these subtleties, the [[effect size]] of the findings are little more than a "statistical blip."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kramer et al. (2014) found a 0.07% &#x2014; that's not 7 percent, that's 1/15th of one percent!! &#x2014; decrease in negative words in people's status updates when the number of negative posts on their Facebook news feed decreased. Do you know how many words you'd have to read or write before you've written one less negative word due to this effect? Probably thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grohol|first1=John|title=Emotional Contagion on Facebook?

The consequences of the controversy are pending (be it FTC or court proceedings) but it did prompt an "[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/07/02/1412469111.full.pdf+html Editorial Expression of Concern]" from its publisher, the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]], as well as an blog posting from [[OkCupid]] that "[http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/we-experiment-on-human-beings/ We experiment on human beings]!" In September 2014, law professor James Grimmelmann argued that the actions of both companies were "illegal, immoral, and mood-altering" and filed notices with the Maryland Attorney General and Cornell Institutional Review Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = James | last1 =  Grimmelmann | title = Illegal, immoral, and mood-altering: How Facebook and OkCupid broke the law when they experimented on users | date = September 23, 2014 | url = https://medium.com/@JamesGrimmelmann/illegal-unethical-and-mood-altering-8b93af772688 | accessdate = September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the study was also criticised by the [[British Psychological Society]] which said, in a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "There has undoubtedly been some degree of harm caused, with many individuals affected by increased levels of negative emotion, with consequent potential economic costs, increase in possible mental health problems and burden on health services. The so-called 'positive' manipulation is also potentially harmful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/01/facebook-socially-irresponsible |title=Facebook's 'experiment' was socially irresponsible &amp;#124; Technology |publisher=The Guardian |date=July 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Real-name policy controversy ===
{{Main|Facebook real-name policy controversy}}

Facebook has a [[real-name system]] policy for [[user profile]]s.  The real-name policy stems from the position "that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/16/living/facebook-name-policy/ |title=Facebook 'real name' policy stirs questions around identity |last=Grinberg |first=Emanuella |date=September 18, 2014 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576|title=What names are allowed on Facebook?|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Facebook |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook's real-name system does not allow adopted names or [[pseudonym]]s, and in its enforcement has suspended accounts of legitimate users, until the user provides identification indicating the name.

===Media impact===
In April 2011, Facebook launched a new portal for marketers and creative agencies to help them develop brand promotions on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/marketing |title=Facebook Marketing Solutions |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began its push by inviting a select group of British advertising leaders to meet Facebook's top executives at an "influencers' summit" in February 2010.

===Social impact===
{{main|Social networking service#Social impact|Social impact of the Internet#Social networking and entertainment}}
Facebook has affected the social life and activity of people in various ways. With its availability on many mobile devices, Facebook allows users to continuously stay in touch with friends, relatives and other acquaintances wherever they are in the world, as long as there is access to the Internet. It can also unite people with common interests and/or beliefs through groups and other pages, and has been known to reunite lost family members and friends because of the widespread reach of its network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/topics/1164/social-networks/chart/1103/top-10-social-networks-in-q1-2013/ Half of the World's Online Population Uses Facebook], GlobalWebIndex.

===Health impact===
Many Facebook users, especially adolescents, display references to alcohol and substance use on their Facebook profiles.&lt;ref name="Real Use Real Cool"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Megan A|last2=Briner|first2=LR|last3= Williams|first3= A|last4= Walker|first4= L|last5= Christakis|first5= DA|title=Real Use or "Real Cool": Adolescents Speak Out About Displayed Alcohol References on Social Networking Web Sites|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|year=2009|volume=45|pages=420&#x2013;421|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.04.015|pmid=19766949|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Egan|first=Katie G|last2=Moreno|first2= MA|title=Alcohol references on undergraduate males' Facebook profiles|journal=Journal of Men's Health|year=2011|volume=5|pages=413&#x2013;20|pmid=21406490|doi=10.1177/1557988310394341|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study of alcohol displays on underage college Facebook users found that 35.7% participant profiles displayed alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Megan A|last2=Christakis|first2= DA|last3=Egan|first3= KG|last4= Brockman|first4= LN|last5= Becker|first5= T|title=Associations between displayed alcohol references on Facebook and problem drinking among college students|journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|date=February 2012|volume=166|issue=2|pages=157&#x2013;63|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.180|pmid=21969360}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can include photos of underage drinking, or status updates describing alcohol or substance use. This is particularly concerning because new social media such as Facebook can influence adolescents by acting as a "superpeer," promoting norms of behavior among other adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strasburger|first=VC|title=Adolescents and the Media|year=2008|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Beverly Hills, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether these displays represent real offline behavior or are posted just to make the Facebook user "look cool", displaying these references may lead to an expectation by friends that the adolescent does or will drink alcohol in the future.&lt;ref name="Real Use Real Cool" /&gt;

====Facebook envy====
Recent studies have shown that Facebook causes negative effects on [[self-esteem]] by triggering feelings of envy, with vacation and holiday photos proving to be the largest resentment triggers. Other prevalent causes of envy include posts by friends about family happiness and images of physical beauty&#x2014;such envious feelings leave people lonely and dissatisfied with their own lives. A joint study by two German universities discovered that one out of three people were more dissatisfied with their lives after visiting Facebook, and another study by [[Utah Valley University]] found that college students felt worse about their own lives following an increase in the amount of time spent on Facebook.&lt;ref name="huffsachs"&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook Envy: How Cruising Can Kill Self Esteem |first=Wendy |last=Sachs |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wendy-sachs/facebook_b_1262681.html |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=February 8, 2012 |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffgoldsmith"&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook Study Says Envy Is Rampant On The Social Network |first=Belinda |last=Goldsmith |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/facebook-study-envy_n_2526549.html |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=January 22, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="healthmag"&gt;{{cite news |title= Facebook Envy When social networking only brings you down |first=Michael |last=Richardson |url= http://www.healthy-mag.com/articles/1343/Facebook-Envy |work=Healthy Magazine |date=May 25, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unfriending psychological impact ====
Although Facebook has an upside of friending people, there is also the downside of having someone [[unfriend]] or reject another person, according to [[psychologist]] [[Susan Krauss Whitbourne]].&lt;ref name="Whitbourne_6_19_2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whitbourne |first=Susan Krauss |title=Unfriended?

Facebook's role in the American political process was demonstrated in January 2008, shortly before the [[New Hampshire primary]], when Facebook teamed up with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[Saint Anselm College]] to allow users to give live feedback about the "back to back" January 5 Republican and Democratic debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Politics/story?id=3899006&amp;page=1 |title=ABC News Joins Forces With Facebook |work=ABC News |date=December 18, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first =Doug |last= Minor |url= http://blogs.saintanselmcollege.net/2007/11/29/abcdebates/ |title=Saint Anselm to Host ABC Debates Jan.&amp;nbsp;5 |publisher= Saint Anselm College blog |date=November 29, 2007 |accessdate=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first =Tahman |last= Bradley |url= http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/abc_wmur_and_facebook_debates/index.html |title= Republicans Lead off ABC News, WMUR-TV and Facebook Back-To-Back Debates in New Hampshire |publisher=ABC News |work= Political Radar blog |date=December 12, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Gibson]] moderated both debates, held at the Dana Center for the Humanities at Saint Anselm College.
