The territory of modern Ukraine has been inhabited by humans since 32,000 BC. During the [[Middle Ages]], the area was a key center of [[List of Slavic cultures|East Slavic culture]], with the powerful state of [[Kievan Rus']] forming the basis of Ukrainian identity. Following its fragmentation in the 13th century, the territory was contested, ruled and divided by a variety of powers, including [[Lithuania]], Poland, the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Austro-Hungary]], and Russia. A [[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossack republic]] emerged and prospered during the 17th and 18th centuries, but Ukraine's territories remained divided until they were consolidated into a [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet republic]] in the 20th century. It became [[Sovereign state|independent]] in 1991.

Ukraine has long been a global [[breadbasket]] because of its extensive, fertile farmlands, and it remains one of the world's largest grain exporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.blackseagrain.net/data/news/ukraine-becomes-worlds-third-biggest-grain-exporter-in-2011-minister |title=Ukraine becomes world's third biggest grain exporter in 2011 &#x2013; minister |publisher=Black Sea Grain |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/wtr13_e.htm |title=World Trade Report 2013|publisher=World Trade Organisation |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's diversified economy includes a well-developed manufacturing sector, particularly in aerospace and industrial equipment, and a nascent tourism sector.

Ukraine is a [[unitary state|unitary republic]] under a [[semi-presidential system]] with [[Separation of powers|separate powers]]: [[Legislature|legislative]], [[executive branch|executive]], and [[judicial]] branches. Its capital and largest city is [[Kiev]]. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Ukraine continues to maintain the second-largest [[Military of Ukraine|military]] in Europe, after that of Russia, when reserves and paramilitary personnel are taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;[[#IISS2010|IISS 2010]], pp. 195&#x2013;197&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to 45.4 million people (including [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea|Crimea]]),&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countryeconomy.com/demography/population/ukraine country Economy] 2014 demographics&lt;/ref&gt; 77.8% of whom are [[Ukrainians]] by ethnicity, and with a sizable minority of [[Russians]] (17%), as well as [[Romanians]]/[[Moldovans]], [[Belarusians]], [[Crimean Tatars]], and [[Hungarians]]. [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is the [[official language]] of Ukraine; its alphabet is [[Ukrainian alphabet|Cyrillic]]. The dominant religion in the country is [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], which has strongly influenced [[Ukrainian architecture]], [[Ukrainian literature|literature]] and [[Music of Ukraine|music]].

==Etymology==
There are different hypotheses as to the etymology of the [[name of Ukraine|name ''Ukraine'']]. According to the older and most widespread hypothesis, it means "borderland",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stay informed today and every day |url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2014/02/linguistic-divides |title=Linguistic divides: Johnson: Is there a single Ukraine? |publisher=Economist.com |date=5 February 2014 |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while more recently some linguistic studies claim a different meaning: "homeland" or "region, country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://litopys.org.ua/pivtorak/pivtorak.htm &#x41F;&#x43E;&#x445;&#x43E;&#x434;&#x436;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x44F; &#x443;&#x43A;&#x440;&#x430;&#x457;&#x43D;&#x446;&#x456;&#x432;, &#x440;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x456;&#x44F;&#x43D;, &#x431;&#x456;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x443;&#x441;&#x456;&#x432; &#x442;&#x430; &#x457;&#x445;&#x43D;&#x456;&#x445; &#x43C;&#x43E;&#x432;] {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Ukraine" was once the usual form in English&lt;ref name="merriam-webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ukraine|title=Ukraine &#x2013; Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]], "the Ukraine" has become much less common in the [[English-speaking world]] and style-guides largely recommend not using the definite [[Article (grammar)|article]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/why-ukraine-isnt-the-ukraine-and-why-that-matters-now-2013-12 Why Ukraine Isn't 'The Ukraine,' And Why That Matters Now], [[Business Insider]] (9 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UKrW812991TU&gt;[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/499102.shtml The "the" is gone], ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'' (8 December 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Goths]] stayed in the area but came under the sway of the [[Huns]] from the 370s AD. In the 7th&amp;nbsp;century AD, the territory of eastern Ukraine was the centre of [[Old Great Bulgaria]].

[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir.jpg|thumb|right|The baptism of the Grand Prince Vladimir led to the adoption of Christianity in [[Kievan Rus']].]]
The Kievan Rus' was founded by the [[Rus' people]], [[Varangians]] who first settled there around [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]] and [[Novgorod]], then gradually moved southward eventually reaching Kiev about 880. Kievan Rus' included the western part of modern Ukraine, and [[Belarus]]. The larger part was situated on the territory of modern Russian Federation. According to the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' the Rus' elite initially consisted of Varangians from [[Scandinavia]].

During the 10th and 11th&amp;nbsp;centuries, it became the largest and most powerful state in Europe.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html|title=Ukraine|accessdate=24 December 2007|date=13 December 2007|work=[[CIA World Factbook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries, it laid the foundation for the national identity of Ukrainians and Russians.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia|edition=6| year=2001&#x2013;2007|article=Kievan Rus|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ki/KievanRu.html|accessdate=8 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722102058/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ki/KievanRu.html|archivedate=22 July 2008}}{{Dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kiev]], the capital of modern Ukraine, became the most important city of the Rus'.

The Varangians later assimilated into the local Slavic population and became part of the first Rus' dynasty, the [[Rurik dynasty|Rurik Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt; Kievan Rus' was composed of several [[principality|principalities]] ruled by the interrelated Rurikid ''[[knyaz]]es'' ("princes"). The seat of Kiev became the subject of many rivalries among Rurikids.

The Golden Age of Kievan Rus' began with the reign of [[Vladimir the Great]] (980&#x2013;1015), who [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|turned Rus' toward Byzantine Christianity]]. During the reign of his son, [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019&#x2013;1054), Kievan Rus' reached the zenith of its cultural development and military power.&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt; This was followed by the state's increasing fragmentation as the relative importance of regional powers rose again. After a final resurgence under the rule of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] (1113&#x2013;1125) and his son [[Mstislav I of Kiev|Mstislav]] (1125&#x2013;1132), Kievan Rus' finally disintegrated into separate principalities following Mstislav's death.

[[File:Rzeczpospolita2nar.png|thumb|left|In the centuries following the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]], much of Ukraine was controlled by Lithuania (from the 14th&amp;nbsp;century on) and since the [[Union of Lublin]] (1569) was included in the [[Polish&#x2013;Lithuanian Commonwealth]] as of 1619, seen in this outline.]]

In the mid-14th&amp;nbsp;century, upon the death of [[Boles&#x142;aw Jerzy II of Mazovia]], king [[Casimir III of Poland]] initiated campaigns (1340&#x2013;1366) to take Galicia-Volhynia. Meanwhile the heartland of Rus', including Kiev, became the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, ruled by [[Gediminas]] and his successors, after the [[Battle on the Irpen' River]]. Following the 1386 [[Union of Krewo]], a [[dynastic union]] between Poland and Lithuania, much of what became northern Ukraine was ruled by the increasingly Slavicised local Lithuanian nobles as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and by 1392 the so-called [[Galicia&#x2013;Volhynia Wars]] ended. Polish colonisers of depopulated lands in northern and central Ukraine founded or refounded many towns. In 1430 [[Podolia]] was incorporated under the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland as [[Podolian Voivodeship]]. In 1441, in the southern Ukraine, especially Crimea and surrounding steppes, [[Genghisid]] prince [[Haci I Giray]] founded the Crimean Khanate.

In 1569 the [[Union of Lublin]] established the Polish&#x2013;Lithuanian Commonwealth, and much Ukrainian territory was transferred from Lithuania to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, becoming Polish territory de jure. Under the demographic, cultural and political pressure of [[Polonisation]] begun already in the late 14th century, many landed gentry of Polish [[Ruthenia]] (another name for the land of Rus) converted to Catholicism and became indistinguishable from the [[Polish nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Subtelny, pp. 92&#x2013;93&lt;/ref&gt; Deprived of native protectors among Rus nobility, the commoners (peasants and townspeople) began turning for protection to the emerging [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], who by the 17th century became devoutly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]. The Cossacks did not shy from taking up arms against those they perceived as enemies, including the Polish state and its local representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-28237|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071011213405/http://britannica.com/eb/article-28237|archivedate=11 October 2007|title=Poland|accessdate=12 September 2007|work=[[Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica]] (fee required)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1657&#x2013;1686 came "[[The Ruin (Ukrainian history)|The Ruin]]", a devastating 30-year war amongst Russia, Poland, Turks and Cossacks for control of Ukraine, which occurred at about the same time as the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] of Poland. Khmelnytsky, deserted by his Tatar allies, suffered a crushing [[Battle of Berestechko|defeat at Berestechko]], and turned to the Russian tsar for help. In 1654, Khmelnytsky signed the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], forming a military and political alliance with Russia that acknowledged loyalty to the tsar. The wars escalated in intensity with hundreds of thousands of deaths. Defeat came in 1686 as the "[[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686|Eternal Peace]]" between Russia and Poland divided the Ukrainian lands between them.

In 1709, Cossack Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa]] (1639&#x2013;1709) defected to [[Sweden]] against Russia in the [[Great Northern War]] (1700&#x2013;1721). Eventually Peter recognized that to consolidate and modernize Russia's political and economic power it was necessary to do away with the [[Cossack Hetmanate|hetmanate]] and Ukrainian and Cossack aspirations to autonomy. Mazepa died in exile after fleeing from the [[Battle of Poltava]] (1709), where the Swedes and their Cossack allies suffered a catastrophic defeat.

The [[Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk]] or Pacts and Constitutions of Rights and Freedoms of the Zaporizhian Host was a 1710 constitutional document written by [[Hetman]] [[Pylyp Orlyk]], a [[Cossack]] of Ukraine, then within the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/63202/ "300th anniversary of first Ukrainian constitution written by Pylyp Orlyk being celebrated"], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'', (5 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

It established a democratic standard for the separation of powers in government between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches, well before the publication of [[Montesquieu]]'s [[The Spirit of the Laws|''Spirit of the Laws'']]. The Constitution limited the executive authority of the hetman, and established a democratically elected [[Cossack]] parliament called the General Council. Pylyp Orlyk's [[Constitution]] was unique for its historic period, and was one of the first state constitutions in Europe.

The hetmanate was abolished in 1764; the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Zaporizhska Sich]] abolished in 1775, as Russia centralised control over its lands. As part of the [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning of Poland]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795, the Ukrainian lands west of the Dnieper were divided between Russia and Austria. From 1737 to 1834, expansion into the northern Black Sea littoral and the eastern [[Danube]] valley was a cornerstone of Russian foreign policy.

Lithuanians and Poles controlled vast estates in Ukraine, and were a law unto themselves. Judicial rulings from [[Cracow]] were routinely flouted, while peasants were heavily taxed and practically tied to the land as [[serf]]s. Occasionally the landowners battled each other using armies of Ukrainian peasants. The Poles and Lithuanians were Roman Catholics and tried with some success to convert the Orthodox lesser nobility. In 1596, they set up the "Greek-Catholic" or [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Uniate Church]]; it dominates western Ukraine to this day. Religious differentiation left the Ukrainian Orthodox peasants leaderless, as they were reluctant to follow the Ukrainian nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Reid (2000) p 27&#x2013;30&lt;/ref&gt;

Cossacks led an uprising, called [[Koliyivschyna|Koliivshchyna]], starting in the Ukrainian borderlands of the Polish&#x2013;Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1768. Ethnicity was one root cause of this revolt, which included Ukrainian [[Massacre of Uman|violence]] that killed tens of thousands of Poles and Jews. Religious warfare also broke out among Ukrainian groups. Increasing conflict between Uniate and Orthodox parishes along the newly reinforced Polish-Russian border on the Dnepr River in the time of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] set the stage for the uprising. As Uniate religious practices had become more Latinized, Orthodoxy in this region drew even closer into dependence on the Russian Orthodox Church. Confessional tensions also reflected opposing Polish and Russian political allegiances.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Skinner, "Borderlands of Faith: Reconsidering the Origins of a Ukrainian Tragedy."

''Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite promises of autonomy in the Treaty of Pereyaslav, the Ukrainian elite and the Cossacks never received the freedoms and the autonomy they were expecting. However, within the Empire, Ukrainians rose to the highest Russian state and [[Russian Orthodox Church|church]] offices.{{Ref label|A|a|none}} At a later period, [[tsarist]]s established a policy of [[Russification]], suppressing the use of the Ukrainian language in print, and in public.&lt;ref name=censor&gt;{{cite journal|last=Remy|first=Johannes|title=The Valuev Circular and Censorship of Ukrainian Publications in the Russian Empire (1863&#x2013;1876): Intention and Practice|journal=Canadian Slavonic Papers / Revue Canadienne des Slavistes|date=March&#x2013;June 2007|volume=47|pages=87&#x2013;110|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40871165|publisher=Canadian Association of Slavists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Ukraine was a rural area largely ignored by Russia and Austria. With growing urbanization and modernization, and a cultural trend toward [[romantic nationalism]], a Ukrainian [[intelligentsia]] committed to national rebirth and social justice emerged. The serf-turned-national-poet [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814&#x2013;1861) and the political theorist [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]] (1841&#x2013;1895) led the growing nationalist movement.

After Ukraine and Crimea became aligned with the Russian Empire in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768&#x2013;1774)]], [[Catherine the Great]] and her immediate successors encouraged German immigration into Ukraine and especially [[Crimea Germans|into Crimea]], to thin the previously dominant Turk population and encourage more complete use of farmland.

Beginning in the 19th century, there was a continuous migration from Ukraine to settle the distant areas of the Russian Empire. According to the 1897 census, there were 223,000 ethnic Ukrainians in [[Siberia]] and 102,000 in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Rainer M&#xFC;nz, Rainer Ohliger (2003).

Nationalist and socialist parties developed in the late 19th century. Austrian [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]], which enjoyed substantial political freedom under the relatively lenient rule of the [[Habsburgs]], became the center of the nationalist movement.

Ukrainians entered [[World War I]] on the side of both the [[Central Powers]], under Austria, and the [[Triple Entente]], under Russia. 3.5 million Ukrainians fought with the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Imperial Russian Army]], while 250,000 fought for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=[[Orest Subtelny|Subtelny, Orest]]|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0-8020-8390-0|pages=340&#x2013;344}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] authorities established the Ukrainian Legion to fight against the Russian Empire. This legion was the foundation of the [[Ukrainian Galician Army]] that fought against the Bolsheviks and Poles in the post-World War I period (1919&#x2013;23). Those suspected of Russophile sentiments in Austria were treated harshly. Thousands were detained and placed in Austrian internment camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Horbal |first=Bogdan |title=Talerhof |url=http://www.rusyn.org/histalerhof.html|accessdate=20 January 2008|publisher=The world academy of Rusyn culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War I brought about the end of the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] ended the Russia empire, led to the founding of the Soviet Union under the [[Bolshevik]]s, and subsequent [[civil war in Russia]]. A Ukrainian national movement for self-determination reemerged, with heavy Communist and Socialist influence. During 1917&#x2013;20, several separate Ukrainian states briefly emerged: the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]], the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] and the pro-Bolshevik [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (or Soviet Ukraine) successively established territories in the former Russian Empire; while the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[Hutsul Republic]] emerged briefly in the former Austro-Hungarian territory. This led to civil war, and an anarchist movement called the [[The Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], developed in Southern Ukraine during that war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkPath=pages\M\A\MakhnoNestor.htm |title=Makhno, Nestor|author=Cipko, Serge|accessdate=17 January 2008|work=Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland defeated Western Ukraine in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]], but failed against the Bolsheviks in [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|an offensive against Kiev]]. According to the [[Peace of Riga]], western Ukraine was officially incorporated into Poland, which in turn recognised the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in March 1919. With establishment of the Soviet power, Ukraine lost half of its territory: the [[eastern Galicia]] was given to Poland, [[Pripyat marshes]] region &#x2013; to Belarus, half of [[Sloboda Ukraine]] and northern fringes of [[Severia]] were passed to Russia, while on the left bank of [[Dniester]] River was created Moldavian autonomy. Ukraine became a founding member of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] or the Soviet Union in December 1922.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30078/Ukraine|title=Interwar Soviet Ukraine|accessdate=12 September 2007|work=[[Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica]] (fee required)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Ruthenians and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia (1918&#x2013;1938)}}
The war in Ukraine continued for another two years; by 1921, however, most of Ukraine had been taken over by the Soviet Union, while Galicia and Volhynia (West Ukraine) were incorporated into independent Poland. [[Bukovina]] was annexed by Romania and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]], with mediation of the [[United States]], was admitted to the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]] as an autonomy.

A powerful underground Ukrainian nationalist movement arose in Poland in the 1920s and 1930s due to Polish national policies in Western Ukraine, which was led by the Ukrainian Military Organization and the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN)]]. The movement attracted a militant following among students. Hostilities between state authorities and the popular movement led to a substantial number of fatalities. The autonomy which had been promised Eastern Galicia (West Ukraine) was never implemented. A number of Ukrainian parties, the Ukrainian Catholic Church, an active press, and a business sector existed in Poland. Economic conditions improved in the 1920s, but the region suffered from the Great Depression in the 1930s.

The [[Russian Civil War]] devastated the whole [[Russian Empire]] including Ukraine. It left over 1.5 million people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless in the former Russian Empire territory. Soviet Ukraine also faced the [[Russian famine of 1921]] (primarily affecting the Russian [[Volga Region|Volga]]-[[Ural (region)|Ural]] region).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volgagermans.net/norka/famine_1920s.html|title=The Famine of 1920-1924

The famine claimed up to 10 million Ukrainian lives as peasants' food stocks were forcibly removed by the [[NKVD]] secret police.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7111296.stm Ukraine remembers famine horror]". BBC News. 24 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some explanations for the excess deaths in rural areas of Ukraine, southern Russia and [[Kazakhstan]] during the [[Soviet famine of 1932&#x2013;33]] have divided the causes into three groups: objective non-policy-related factors, like the drought of 1931 and poor weather in 1932; inadvertent result of policies with other objectives, like rapid industrialisation, socialisation of livestock and neglected [[crop rotation]] patterns; and intentional starvation policy. The Communist leadership perceived famine as a means of class struggle and used starvation as a punishment tool to force peasants into collective farms.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ellman, "The Role of Leadership Perceptions and of Intent in the Soviet Famine of 1931&#x2013;1934."

Largely the same groups were responsible for the mass killing operations during the civil war, collectivisation, and the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]]. These groups were associated with Efim Georgievich Evdokimov (1891&#x2013;1939) and operated in the Secret Operational Division within General State Political Administration (OGPU) in 1929&#x2013;31. Evdokimov transferred into Communist Party administration in 1934, when he became Party secretary for North Caucasus Krai. But he appears to have continued advising Joseph Stalin and [[Nikolai Yezhov]] on security matters, and the latter relied on Evdokimov's former colleagues to carry out the mass killing operations that are known as the Great Terror in 1937&#x2013;38.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G.

Following the [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Soviet Army|Soviet]] troops divided the territory of Poland. Thus, Eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Volhynia]] with their Ukrainian population became reunited with the rest of Ukraine. For the first time in history, the nation was united.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subtelny, p. 487&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kovpak partisanki.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ukrainian guerrillas in World War II, members of the [[Sydir Kovpak]] partisan detachment]]
In 1940, [[Romania]] ceded [[Bessarabia]] and northern [[Bukovina]] in response to [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet demands]]. The Ukrainian SSR incorporated northern and southern districts of Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and the [[Hertsa region]]. But it ceded the western part of the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] to the newly created [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. All these territorial gains were internationally recognised by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaties of 1947]].

[[Wehrmacht|German armies]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, thereby initiating four straight years of incessant [[total war]]. The [[Axis Powers|Axis]] allies initially advanced against desperate but unsuccessful efforts of the [[Red Army]]. In the encirclement [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|battle of Kiev]], the city was acclaimed as a "[[Hero City]]", because of its fierce [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|resistance]]. More than 600,000 Soviet soldiers (or one-quarter of the [[Soviet Western Front]]) were killed or [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|taken captive]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boshyk, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily it was created as forces of [[President of Ukraine (in exile)|Ukrainian Government in exile]]&lt;ref&gt;Subtelny, Orest (1988).

Both supported the goal of an [[Declaration of Ukrainian Independence, 1941|independent Ukrainian state]] on the territory with Ukrainian ethnic majority. Although this brought conflict with Nazi Germany, at times the [[Andriy Melnyk|Melnyk]]-wing of OUN allied with the Nazi forces.

Most of the Ukrainian SSR was organised within the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]], with the intention of exploiting its resources and eventual German settlement. Initially, some western Ukrainians, who had only joined the Soviet Union in 1939 under pressure, hailed the Germans as liberators. But brutal German rule in the occupied territories eventually turned its supporters against them. Nazi administrators of conquered Soviet territories made little attempt to exploit dissatisfaction with Stalinist political and economic policies.&lt;ref name=ww2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/612921/Ukraine/30080/Bukovina-under-Romanian-rule#toc30082|title=Ukraine &#x2013; World War II and its aftermath|accessdate=28 December 2007|work=Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the Nazis preserved the collective-farm system, systematically carried out [[Mass graves in the Soviet Union|genocidal policies]] against [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Jews]], [[OST-Arbeiter|deported millions of people to work in Germany]], and began a systematic depopulation of Ukraine (along with Poland) to prepare it for German colonisation.&lt;ref name=ww2/&gt; They blockaded the transport of food on the Kiev River.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karel C.

Post-war [[ethnic cleansing]] occurred in the newly expanded Soviet Union. As of 1 January 1953, Ukrainians were second only to Russians among adult "[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special deportees]]", comprising 20% of the total.&lt;ref name="Malynovska"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.niisp.org.ua/defa~177.php | title =Migration and migration policy in Ukraine | first=Olena | last=Malynovska | date=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, over 450,000 ethnic [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|Germans]] from Ukraine and more than 200,000 [[Crimean Tatars]] were victims of [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forced deportations]].&lt;ref name="Malynovska"/&gt;

Following the death of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the new leader of the USSR. Having served as First Secretary of the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine|Communist Party of Ukrainian SSR]] in 1938&#x2013;49, Khrushchev was intimately familiar with the republic; after taking power union-wide, he began to emphasize the friendship between the Ukrainian and Russian nations. In 1954, the 300th anniversary of the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] was widely celebrated. [[Crimean Oblast|Crimea]] was [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] from the [[Russian SFSR]] to the [[Ukrainian SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccrimea.org/historical/crimeatransfer.html|title=The Transfer of Crimea to Ukraine|accessdate=25 March 2007|date=July 2005|work=International Committee for Crimea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1950, the republic had fully surpassed pre-war levels of industry and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30084/Ukraine|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080115052626/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30084/Ukraine | archivedate=15 January 2008 | title=Ukraine &#x2013; The last years of Stalin's rule|accessdate=28 December 2007|work=Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica (fee required)}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1946&#x2013;1950 [[Five-Year Plan (USSR)|five-year plan]], nearly 20% of the Soviet budget was invested in Soviet Ukraine, a 5% increase from prewar plans. As a result, the Ukrainian workforce rose 33.2% from 1940 to 1955 while industrial output grew 2.2 times in that same period.

Soviet Ukraine soon became a European leader in industrial production,&lt;ref&gt;Magocsi, p. 644&lt;/ref&gt; and an important centre of the Soviet [[arms industry]] and high-tech research. Such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite. Many members of the Soviet leadership came from Ukraine, most notably [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. He later ousted Khrushchev and became the Soviet leader from 1964 to 1982. Many prominent Soviet sports players, scientists, and artists came from Ukraine.

This started a period of confrontation with the central Soviet authorities. In August 1991, a conservative faction among the Communist leaders of the Soviet Union [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|attempted a coup]] to remove [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and to restore the Communist party's power.

A [[Ukrainian independence referendum, 1991|referendum]] and the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 1991|first presidential elections]] took place on 1 December 1991.

At the [[Belavezha Accords|meeting in Brest]], Belarus on 8 December, followed by the [[Alma Ata]] meeting on 21 December, the leaders of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine formally dissolved the Soviet Union and formed the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Soviet Leaders Recall 'Inevitable' Breakup Of Soviet Union|url=http://rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/12/14b6b499-9eb2-4dee-b96c-784ec918969a.html|work=[[RadioFreeEurope]]|date=8 December 2006|accessdate=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, after a summit hosted in Belarus, Poroshenko negotiated a ceasefire with the separatist troops. This included conditions such as the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the front line and decentralisation of rebel regions by the end of 2015. It also included conditions such as the Ukrainian control of the border with Russia in 2015 and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Ukrainian territory. The ceasefire began at midnight on 15 February 2015.

== Historical maps of states ==
Several states have existed on the territory of present-day Ukraine since its foundation.  Most of these territories have been located within [[Eastern Europe]].  However, as depicted in the maps here, they have at times extended well into [[Eurasia]] and [[Southeastern Europe]].  At other times there has been no distinct Ukrainian state, its territories having been annexed by its more powerful neighbours.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Ukraine}}

At {{convert|603628|km2|sqmi}} and with a coastline of {{convert|2782|km|mi}}, Ukraine is the world's [[List of countries and outlying territories by area|46th-largest country]] (after [[South Sudan]], before [[Madagascar]]). It is the largest wholly European country and the [[Europe#Territories and regions|second largest country]] in Europe (after the European part of Russia, before [[metropolitan France]]).{{Ref label|I|i|none}}&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; It lies between latitudes [[44th parallel north|44&#xB0;]] and [[53rd parallel north|53&#xB0; N]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian east|22&#xB0;]] and [[41st meridian east|41&#xB0; E]].

The landscape of Ukraine consists mostly of fertile plains (or [[steppes]]) and plateaus, crossed by rivers such as the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] ({{lang|uk-Latn|''Dnipro''}}), [[Seversky Donets]], [[Dniester]] and the [[Southern Bug|Southern Buh]] as they flow south into the [[Black Sea]] and the smaller [[Sea of Azov]]. To the southwest, the [[Danube Delta|delta]] of the [[Danube]] forms the border with Romania. Its various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands. The country's only mountains are the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, of which the highest is the [[Hora Hoverla]] at {{convert|2061|m}}, and the [[Crimean Mountains]] on Crimea, in the extreme south along the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30093/Ukraine|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080115052701/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30093/Ukraine|archivedate=15 January 2008|title=Ukraine &#x2013; Relief|accessdate=27 December 2007|work=Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica (fee required)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Ukraine also has a number of highland regions such as the Volyn-Podillia Upland (in the west) and the Near-Dnipro Upland (on the right bank of Dnieper); to the east there are the south-western spurs of the Central Russian Uplands over which runs the border with Russian Federation. Near the Sea of Azov can be found the Donets Ridge and the Near Azov Upland. The [[snow melt]] from the mountains feeds the rivers, and natural changes in altitude form a sudden drop in elevation and create many opportunities to form [[waterfalls of Ukraine|waterfalls]].

Significant natural resources in Ukraine include iron ore, coal, manganese, natural gas, oil, salt, sulphur, graphite, titanium, magnesium, kaolin, nickel, mercury, timber and an abundance of arable land. Despite this, the country faces a number of major environmental issues such as inadequate supplies of potable water; air and water pollution and deforestation, as well as radiation contamination in the north-east from the [[Chernobyl disaster|1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]]. [[Hazardous Waste Recycling|Recycling toxic household waste]] is still in its infancy in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/118498/ Environment suffers from lack of recycling], [[Kyiv Post]] (9 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodiversity===
Ukraine is home to a very wide range of animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants.

Ukraine is divided into two main zoological areas. One of these areas, in the west of the country, is made up of the borderlands of Europe, where there are species typical of mixed forests, the other is located in eastern Ukraine, where steppe-dwelling species thrive. In the forested areas of the country it is not uncommon to find lynxes, wolves, wild boar and martens, as well as many other similar species; this is especially true of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], where a large number of predatory mammals make their home, as well as a contingent of brown bears. Around Ukraine's lakes and rivers beavers, otters and mink make their home, whilst within, carp, bream and catfish are the most commonly found species of fish. In the central and eastern parts of the country, rodents such as hamsters and gophers are found in large numbers.

====Fungi====
More than 6,600 [[species]] of [[Fungus|fungi]] (including [[lichen]]-forming species) have been recorded from Ukraine,&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Minter and Dudka, I.O.

The true total number of fungal species occurring in Ukraine, including species not yet recorded, is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, P.M., Cannon, P.F., Minter, D.W. and Stalpers, J. "Dictionary of the Fungi". Edn 10.

Ukraine is a republic under a mixed semi-parliamentary [[semi-presidential system]] with separate [[legislative branch|legislative]], [[executive branch|executive]], and [[judicial branch]]es.

===The Constitution of Ukraine===
{{Main|Constitution of Ukraine}}
With the proclamation of its independence on 24 August 1991, and adoption of a constitution on 28 June 1996, Ukraine became a semi-presidential republic. However, in 2004, deputies introduced changes to the Constitution, which tipped the balance of power in favour of a [[parliamentary system]]. From 2004 to 2010, the legitimacy of the 2004 Constitutional amendments had official sanction, both with the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and most major political parties.&lt;ref name="1oct"&gt;{{cite web|author=&#x412;&#x456;&#x442;&#x430;&#x43B;&#x456;&#x439; &#x41F;&#x43E;&#x440;&#x442;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x43A;&#x43E;&#x432; |url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/2174109.html |title=Vitaly Portnykov. "Comment on the Constitutional Court of Ukraine on elimination of political reform in 2004 for Radio Liberty asked Nicholas Onischuk, former Justice Minister&amp;nbsp;... 25 February 2008 the Constitutional Court came to the conclusion that this bill can not be subject to constitutional control, but now we see that the Constitutional Court concluded that it can". 01.10.2010 |publisher=Radiosvoboda.org |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, on 30 September 2010 the Constitutional Court ruled that the amendments were null and void, forcing a return to the terms of the 1996 Constitution and again making Ukraine's political system more presidential in character.

The ruling on the 2004 Constitutional amendments became a major topic of political discourse. Much of the concern was due to the fact that neither the Constitution of 1996 nor the Constitution of 2004 provided the ability to "undo the Constitution", as the decision of the Constitutional Court would have it, even though the 2004 constitution arguably has an exhaustive list of possible procedures for constitutional amendments (articles 154&#x2013;159). In any case, the current Constitution could be modified by a vote in Parliament.&lt;ref name="1oct"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/3o3zxoz9 |title=Address Tymoshenko to the people: "1 October 2010 &#x2013; marks the end of Ukraine's democracy and beginning of dictatorship".

On 21 February 2014 an agreement between President Viktor Yanukovych and opposition leaders saw the country return to the 2004 Constitution. The historic agreement, brokered by the [[European Union]], followed protests that began in late November 2013 and culminated in a week of violent clashes in which scores of protesters were killed. In addition to returning the country to the 2004 Constitution, the deal provided for the formation of a coalition government, the calling of early elections, and the release of former Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] from prison.&lt;ref name="Ukraine2014protests"&gt;{{cite web|title=President Yanukovych and Ukraine opposition sign early poll deal|url=http://www.europesun.com/index.php/sid/220190358/scat/88176adfdf246af5/ht/President-Yanukovych-and-Ukraine-opposition-sign-early-poll-deal|date=19 February 2014|publisher=''Europe Sun''}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day after the agreement was reached the Ukraine parliament dismissed Yanukovych and installed its speaker [[Oleksandr Turchynov]] as interim president&lt;ref name="UkrainePresidentReplaced"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ukraine: Speaker Oleksandr Turchynov named interim president|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26312008|date=19 February 2014|publisher=''BBC News''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] as the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/who-governing-ukraine-olexander-turchynov Who exactly is governing Ukraine?]".

===The president, parliament and government===

The [[President of Ukraine|President]] is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and is the formal [[head of state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article%3fart_id=235995&amp;cat_id=32672 |title=General Articles about Ukraine |accessdate=24 December 2007|work=Government Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ukraine's legislative branch includes the 450-seat [[unicameral]] parliament, the [[Verkhovna Rada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://portal.rada.gov.ua/|title=Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine |accessdate=24 December 2007 |work=[[Verkhovna Rada|Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine]] Official Web-site}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament is primarily responsible for the formation of the executive branch and the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|Cabinet of Ministers]], headed by the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine |title=Constitution of Ukraine |accessdate=24 December 2007|work=[[Wikisource]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the President still retains the authority to nominate the Ministers of the Foreign Affairs and of Defence for parliamentary approval, as well as the power to appoint the [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine|Prosecutor General]] and the head of the [[Security Service of Ukraine|Security Service]].

Laws, acts of the parliament and the cabinet, presidential decrees, and acts of the [[Verkhovna Rada of Crimea|Crimean parliament]] may be abrogated by the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine|Constitutional Court]], should they be found to violate the constitution. Other normative acts are subject to judicial review. The [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Supreme Court]] is the main body in the system of courts of general jurisdiction.
Local self-government is officially guaranteed. Local councils and city mayors are popularly elected and exercise control over local budgets. The heads of regional and district administrations are appointed by the President in accordance with the proposals of the Prime Minister. This system virtually requires an agreement between the President and the Prime Minister, and has in the past led to problems, such as when President Yushchenko exploited a perceived loophole by appointing so-called 'temporarily acting' officers, instead of actual governors or local leaders, thus evading the need to seek a compromise with the Prime Minister. This practice was controversial and was subject to Constitutional Court review.

Ukraine has a large number of political parties, many of which have tiny memberships and are unknown to the general public.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Small parties often join in multi-party coalitions (electoral blocs) for the purpose of participating in parliamentary elections.

=== Courts and law enforcement ===

The courts enjoy legal, financial and constitutional freedom guaranteed by Ukrainian law since 2002. Judges are largely well protected from dismissal (except in the instance of gross misconduct). Court justices are appointed by presidential decree for an initial period of five years, after which Ukraine's Supreme Council confirms their positions for life. Although there are still problems, the system is considered to have been much improved since Ukraine's independence in 1991. The Supreme Court is regarded as an independent and impartial body, and has on several occasions ruled against the Ukrainian government. The [[World Justice Project]] ranks Ukraine 66 out of 99 countries surveyed in its annual Rule of Law Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldjusticeproject.org/#/index/UKR|title=WJP Rule of Law Index Rankings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement agencies in Ukraine are organised under the authority of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine|Ministry of Internal Affairs]]. They consist primarily of the national police force ''([[Militsiya|&#x41C;i&#x43B;i&#x446;i&#x44F;]])'' and various specialised units and agencies such as the [[State Border Guard Service of Ukraine|State Border Guard]] and the [[Ukrainian Sea Guard|Coast Guard]] services. Law enforcement agencies, particularly the police, faced criticism for their heavy handling of the 2004 [[Orange Revolution]]. Many thousands of police officers were stationed throughout the capital, primarily to dissuade protesters from challenging the state's authority but also to provide a quick reaction force in case of need; most officers were armed.&lt;ref name=NYTSBU&gt;C.

Gen. [[Sergei Popkov]] heeded his colleagues' calls to withdraw.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs is also responsible for the maintenance of the [[Security Service of Ukraine|State Security Service]]; Ukraine's domestic intelligence agency, which has on occasion been accused of acting like a [[secret police]] force serving to protect the country's political elite from media criticism. On the other hand however, it is widely accepted that members of the service provided vital information about government plans to the leaders of the Orange Revolution to prevent the collapse of the movement.

In 1999&#x2013;2001, Ukraine served as a non-permanent member of the [[UN Security Council]]. Historically, Soviet Ukraine joined the United Nations in 1945 as one of the original members following a Western compromise with the Soviet Union, which had asked for seats for all 15 of its union republics. Ukraine has consistently supported peaceful, negotiated settlements to disputes. It has participated in the quadripartite talks on the conflict in Moldova and promoted a peaceful resolution to conflict in the post-Soviet state of Georgia. Ukraine also has made a substantial contribution to UN [[peacekeeping]] operations since 1992.

The [[European Union]]'s Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with Ukraine went into force on 1 March 1998. The European Union (EU) has encouraged Ukraine to implement the PCA fully before discussions begin on an association agreement. The EU Common Strategy toward Ukraine, issued at the EU Summit in December 1999 in [[Helsinki]], recognizes Ukraine's long-term aspirations but does not discuss association. On 31 January 1992, Ukraine joined the then-Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (now the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), and on 10 March 1992, it became a member of the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]]. Ukraine also has a close relationship with [[NATO]] and has declared interest in eventual membership.&lt;ref name="result of Russia"/&gt; This was removed from the government's foreign policy agenda upon election of [[Viktor Yanukovych]] to the presidency, in 2010.&lt;ref name="result of Russia"/&gt; But after February 2014's [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|Yanukovych ouster]] and the (denied by Russia) following [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]] Ukraine renewed its drive for NATO membership.&lt;ref name="result of Russia"/&gt; Ukraine is the most active member of the [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP). All major political parties in Ukraine support full eventual integration into the European Union. The Association Agreement with the EU was expected to be signed and put into effect by the end of 2011, but the process was suspended by 2012 due to the political developments of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/116043/ | title=Teixeira: Ukraine's EU integration suspended, association agreement unlikely to be signed | publisher=[[Interfax]] | date=31 August 2012 | accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukraine maintains peaceful and constructive relations with all its neighbours; it had enjoyed especially close ties with [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], although relations with the former were complicated by the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]], energy dependence and payment disputes following the events of February 2014.

Ukraine is included in the European Union's [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Ukraine|Ukrainian historical regions}}
The system of Ukrainian subdivisions reflects the country's status as a [[unitary state]] (as stated in the country's constitution) with unified legal and [[Local government|administrative]] regimes for each unit.

Ukraine consists of 27 regions which are twenty-four [[oblast]]s (provinces) and one [[autonomous republic]] ({{lang|uk-Latn|''avtonomna respublika''}}), [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea|Crimea]]. Additionally, the cities of [[Kiev]], the capital, and [[Sevastopol]], both have a special legal status. The 24 oblasts and Crimea are subdivided into 490 {{lang|uk-Latn|''[[raion]]s''}} (districts) and city municipalities of regional significance, or second-level administrative units. The average area of a Ukrainian raion is {{convert|1200|km2|sqmi}}; the average population of a raion is 52,000 people.&lt;ref name="oblasts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gska2.rada.gov.ua:7777/pls/z7502/a002|title=Regions of Ukraine and their divisions|accessdate=24 December 2007|work=[[Verkhovna Rada|Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine]] Official Web-site|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Populated places in Ukraine]] are split into two categories: urban and rural. Urban populated places are split further into cities and [[urban-type settlement]]s (a Soviet administrative invention), while rural populated places consist of villages and settlements (a generally used term). All cities have certain degree of self-rule depending on their significance such as national significance (as in the case of Kiev and Sevastopol), regional significance (within each oblast or autonomous republic) or district significance (all the rest of cities). City's significance depends on several factors such as its population, socio-economic and historical importance, infrastructure and others.

Following the [[2014 Crimean crisis]], [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea|Crimea]] and [[Sevastopol]] became [[de facto]] administrated by the Russian Federation, which [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|claims them]] as the [[Republic of Crimea]] and the [[Federal cities of Russia|federal city]] of [[Sevastopol]]. They are still recognised as being Ukrainian territory by the majority of the international community.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine inherited a 780,000-man military force on its territory, equipped with the third-largest [[nuclear weapons and Ukraine|nuclear weapons arsenal]] in the world.&lt;ref name=milgov/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/ukraine/index.html |title=Ukraine Special Weapons |accessdate=24 December 2007 |publisher= GlobalSecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1992, Ukraine signed the [[Lisbon Protocol]] in which the country agreed to give up all nuclear weapons to Russia for disposal and to join the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] as a non-nuclear weapon state. Ukraine ratified the treaty in 1994, and by 1996 the country became free of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=milgov&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mil.gov.ua/index.php?lang=en&amp;part=history&amp;sub=history |title=The history of the Armed Forces of Ukraine |accessdate=5 July 2008|publisher= [[Ministry of Defence of Ukraine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukraine took consistent steps toward reduction of conventional weapons. It signed the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], which called for reduction of tanks, artillery, and armoured vehicles (army forces were reduced to 300,000). The country plans to convert the current [[conscript]]-based military into a professional [[volunteer military]].&lt;ref name="wbook06"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mil.gov.ua/files/white_book_eng2006.pdf |title=White Book 2006 |accessdate=24 December 2007 |publisher= Ministry of Defense of Ukraine}}{{dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the government was leaning towards NATO, and a deeper cooperation with the alliance was set by the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan signed in 2002.

In Soviet times, the economy of Ukraine was the second largest in the Soviet Union, being an important industrial and agricultural component of the country's [[planned economy]].&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; With the dissolution of the Soviet system, the country moved from a planned economy to a [[market economy]]. The transition process was difficult for the majority of the population which plunged into poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/966616.stm |title=Child poverty soars in eastern Europe|publisher=BBC News |date=11 October 2000 |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine's economy contracted severely following the years after the Soviet dissolution. Day-to-day life for the average person living in Ukraine was a struggle. A significant number of citizens in rural Ukraine survived by growing their own food, often working two or more jobs and buying the basic necessities through the [[barter economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30078/Ukraine|title=Independent Ukraine|accessdate=12 September 2007|work=[[Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica]] (fee required)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the government liberalised most prices to combat widespread product shortages, and was successful in overcoming the problem. At the same time, the government continued to subsidise state-run industries and agriculture by uncovered monetary emission. The loose monetary policies of the early 1990s pushed inflation to [[hyperinflation]]ary levels. For the year 1993, Ukraine holds the world record for inflation in one calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Skolotiany|first=Yuriy|title=The past and the future of Ukrainian national currency|url=http://www.mw.ua/2000/2040/54367/|accessdate=8 January 2014|newspaper=[[Zerkalo nedeli]]|date=8 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625041853/http://www.mw.ua/2000/2040/54367/|archivedate=25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those living on fixed incomes suffered the most.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Prices stabilised only after the introduction of new currency, the [[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnia]], in 1996.

The country was also slow in implementing structural reforms. Following independence, the government formed a legal framework for [[privatisation]]. However, widespread resistance to reforms within the government and from a significant part of the population soon stalled the reform efforts. A large number of state-owned enterprises were exempt from the privatisation process.

In the meantime, by 1999, the GDP had fallen to less than 40% of the 1991 level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/factbook/print/up.html|title=Ukraine |edition=2002 |accessdate=5 July 2008 |work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recovered considerably in the following years, but as at 2014 had yet to reach the historical maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/ukraine/gdp#NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.KD|title=Ukraine &#x2013; gdp|accessdate=15 July 2012|work=Index Mundi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, the economy showed strong export-based growth of 5 to 10%, with industrial production growing more than 10% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact2004/geos/up.html|title=CIA World Factbook &#x2013; Ukraine. 2004 edition|accessdate=5 July 2008|work=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine was hit by the [[economic crisis of 2008]] and in November 2008, the IMF approved a stand-by loan of $16.5 billion for the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/3243/ "Head of IMF's Resident Representative Office in Ukraine to change his job"].

Rail transport in Ukraine plays the role of connecting all major urban areas, port facilities and [[industry|industrial centres]] with neighbouring countries. The heaviest concentration of [[railway track]] is located in the [[Donbas]] region of Ukraine. Although the amount of [[freight]] transported by rail fell by 7.4% in 1995 in comparison with 1994, Ukraine is still one of the [[rail usage statistics by country|world's highest rail users]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps3997/9510uktn.htm|title=Transportation in Ukraine|accessdate=22 December 2007|work= U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount of railroad track in Ukraine extends for {{convert|22473|km|mi}}, of which {{convert|9250|km|mi}} is electrified.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; Currently the state has a monopoly on the provision of passenger rail transport, and all trains, other than those with cooperation of other foreign companies on international routes, are operated by its company '[[Ukrainian Railways|Ukrzaliznytsia]]'.

===Population decline===
Ukraine's population has been declining since the 1990s due to its high death rate and a low birth rate. The population is shrinking by over 150,000 annually since 1993. The birth rate has recovered in recent years from a low level around 2000, and is now comparable to the European average. It would need to increase by another 50% or so to stabilize the population and offset the high mortality rate.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 2007, the country's rate of population decline was the fourth highest in the world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2002.html|title=Field Listing &#x2013; Population growth rate|accessdate=5 July 2008|work=CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life expectancy is falling, and Ukraine suffers a high [[mortality rate]] from environmental pollution, poor diets, widespread smoking, extensive alcoholism and deteriorating medical care.&lt;ref name="Starostenko1998"&gt;Hanna H. Starostenko, [http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/wumag_old/archiv/2_98/economic.htm "Economic and Ecological Factors of Transformations in Demographic Process in Ukraine"], ''Uktraine Magazine'' No. 2, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldbank1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/html/prddr/trans/julaug99/pgs3-4.htm|title=What Went Wrong with Foreign Advice in Ukraine?|accessdate=16 January 2008|work=The World Bank Group}}{{Dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 2008 to 2010, more than 1.5 million children were born in Ukraine, compared to fewer than 1.2 million during 1999&#x2013;2001 during the worst of the demographic crisis. In 2008 Ukraine posted record-breaking birth rates since its 1991 independence. Infant mortality rates have also dropped from 10.4 deaths to 8.3 per 1,000 children under one year of age. This is lower than in 153 countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html?countryName=Ukraine&amp;countryCode=up&amp;regionCode=eur&amp;rank=154#up |title=Infant mortality rate, Ukraine |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertility and natalist policies===
[[File:&#x41D;&#x430;&#x441;&#x435;&#x43B;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x44F; &#x423;&#x43A;&#x440;&#x430;&#x457;&#x43D;&#x438; (1950-2012).svg|thumb|right|Population of Ukraine (in thousands) from 1950 to 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2007/ds/nas_rik/nas_e/nas_rik_e.html State Statistics Committee of Ukraine] Retrieved 18 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_pop.php Demoscope] Retrieved 18 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The current birth rate in Ukraine, as of 2010, is 10.8 births/1,000 population, and the death rate is 15.2 deaths/1,000 population (see [[Demographics of Ukraine|demographic tables]])

The phenomenon of lowest-low fertility, defined as total fertility below 1.3, is emerging throughout Europe and is attributed by many to postponement of the initiation of childbearing. Ukraine, where total fertility (a very low 1.1 in 2001), was one of the world's lowest, shows that there is more than one pathway to lowest-low fertility. Although Ukraine has undergone immense political and economic transformations during 1991&#x2013;2004, it has maintained a young age at first birth and nearly universal childbearing. Analysis of official national statistics and the Ukrainian Reproductive Health Survey show that fertility declined to very low levels without a transition to a later pattern of childbearing. Findings from focus group interviews suggest explanations of the early fertility pattern. These findings include the persistence of traditional norms for childbearing and the roles of men and women, concerns about medical complications and infertility at a later age, and the link between early fertility and early marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perelli-Harris | first1 = Brienna | year = 2005 | title = The Path to Lowest-low Fertility in Ukraine | journal = Population Studies | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 55&#x2013;70 | jstor = 30040436 | doi = 10.1080/0032472052000332700 | pmid = 15764134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help mitigate the declining population, the government continues to increase child support payments. Thus it provides one-time payments of 12,250 Hryvnias for the first child, 25,000 Hryvnias for the second and 50,000 Hryvnias for the third and fourth, along with monthly payments of 154 Hryvnias per child.&lt;ref name=BohdanD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://me.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=115924&amp;cat_id=38912|title=Bohdan Danylyshyn at the Economic ministry|accessdate=1 February 2008|work=Economic Ministry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/data/1_21296.html|title=President meets with business bosses|accessdate=1 February 2008|work=Press office of President Victor Yushchenko |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20071214153647/http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/data/1_21296.html |archivedate = 14 December 2007}}{{Dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demographic trend is showing signs of improvement, as the birth rate has been steadily growing since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/express/expr2009/1109/238.zip The demographic situation in Ukraine in January&#x2013;September 2009]{{Dead link|date=March 2014}}, [[State Statistics Committee of Ukraine]]&lt;/ref&gt; Net population growth over the first nine months of 2007 was registered in five provinces of the country (out of 24), and population shrinkage was showing signs of stabilising nationwide.

A distant second by the number of the followers is the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], which practices a similar [[liturgy|liturgical]] and spiritual tradition as Eastern Orthodoxy, but is in [[full communion|communion]] with the [[Holy See]] of the Roman Catholic Church and recognises the primacy of the Pope as head of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugcc.org.ua/eng/ugcc_history/definition/|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080226124455/http://www.ugcc.org.ua/eng/ugcc_history/definition/|archivedate=26 February 2008|title=Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC)|accessdate=27 January 2008}}{{Dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are 863 [[Latin Rite]] Catholic communities, and 474 clergy members serving some one million Latin Rite Catholics in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=derzhkomrelig/&gt; The group forms some 2.19&amp;nbsp;percent of the population and consists mainly of ethnic [[Poles]] and [[Hungarians]], who live predominantly in the western regions of the country. [[Protestants in Ukraine]] form around 2.19&amp;nbsp;percent of the population. Smaller groups are also present.

There are an estimated 500,000 [[Islam in Ukraine|Muslims]] in Ukraine and about 300,000 of them are [[Crimean Tatars]].&lt;ref name="FreedomReport2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012/eur/208378.htm |title = 2012 Report on International Religious Freedom &#x2013; Ukraine |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |date=20 May 2013 |accessdate= 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 487 registered Muslim communities, 368 of them on Crimea. In addition, some 50,000 Muslims live in [[Kiev]]; mostly foreign-born.&lt;ref name="FreedomReport2007"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90205.htm|title=2007 Report on International Religious Freedom &#x2013; Ukraine |year = 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2013 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Jewish]] population is a tiny fraction of what it was before [[World War II]]. In Tsarist times, Ukraine had been part of the [[Pale of Settlement]], to which Jews were largely restricted in the Russian Empire. The largest Jewish communities in 1926 were in [[Odessa]], 154,000 or 36.5% of the total population; and Kiev, 140,500 or 27.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/J/E/Jews.htm | contribution = Jews | title = Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orthodox Judaism]] has the strongest presence in Ukraine. Smaller [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] ([[Masorti]]) communities exist.&lt;ref name =derzhkomrelig /&gt;

One 2006 survey put the number of [[irreligion|non-religious]] in Ukraine at approximately 11.1% of the population.&lt;ref name = Razumkov /&gt;

===Famines and migration===
The [[Holodomor|famines of the 1930s]], followed by the devastation of World War II, comprised a demographic disaster. Life expectancy at birth fell to a level as low as ten years for females and seven for males in 1933 and plateaued around 25 for females and 15 for males in the period 1941&#x2013;44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vallin | first1 = Jacques | last2 = Mesl&#xE9; | first2 = France | last3 = Adamets | first3 = Serguei | last4 = Pyrozhkov | first4 = Serhii | year = 2002 | title = A New Estimate of Ukrainian Population Losses During the Crises of the 1930s and 1940s | journal = Population Studies | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 249&#x2013;264 | jstor = 3092980 | doi = 10.1080/00324720215934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Oxford companion to World War II'', "Over 7 million inhabitants of Ukraine, more than one-sixth of the pre-war population, were killed during the Second World War."&lt;ref&gt;Ian Dear, Michael Richard Daniell Foot (2001).

ISBN 0-19-860446-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant migration took place in the first years of Ukrainian independence. More than one&amp;nbsp;million people moved into Ukraine in 1991&#x2013;92, mostly from the other former Soviet republics. In total, between 1991 and 2004, 2.2&amp;nbsp;million immigrated to Ukraine (among them, 2&amp;nbsp;million came from the other former Soviet Union states), and 2.5&amp;nbsp;million emigrated from Ukraine (among them, 1.9&amp;nbsp;million moved to other former Soviet Union republics).&lt;ref name=MigrationMalynovska&gt;Malynovska, Olena (January 2006).

National Institute for International Security Problems, Kiev. Retrieved 3 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, immigrants constitute an estimated 14.7% of the total population, or 6.9&amp;nbsp;million people; this is the [[List of countries by immigrant population|fourth largest]] figure in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/2006Migration_Chart/2006IttMig_wallchart.xls |title=International migration 2006 |accessdate=5 July 2008 |publisher= United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, there were an estimated 1.2 million [[Ukrainian Canadian|Canadians]] of Ukrainian ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=01&amp;Data=Count&amp;Table=2&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=3&amp;Display=All&amp;CSDFilter=5000 "Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for [[Canada]], provinces and territories &#x2013; 20% sample data"].

The [[Ukrainian Red Cross Society]] was established in April 1918 in [[Kyiv]] as an independent humanitarian society of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Its immediate tasks were to help refugees and prisoners of war, care for handicapped people and orphaned children, fight famine and epidemics, support and organize sick quarters, hospitals and public canteens. At present, society involves more than 6.3 million supporters and activists. Its Visiting Nurses Service has 3200 qualified nurses. The organization takes part in more than 40 humanitarian programmes all over Ukraine, which are mostly funded by public donation and corporate partnerships. By its own estimates, the Society annually provides services to more than 105 000 lonely, elderly people, about 23 000 people disabled during the Second World War and handicapped workers, more than 25 000 war veterans, and more than 8 000 adults handicapped since childhood. Assistance for orphaned and disabled children is also rendered.

Ukraine's healthcare system is state subsidised and freely available to all Ukrainian citizens and registered residents. However, it is not compulsory to be treated in a state-run hospital as a number of private medical complexes do exist nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestofukraine.com/travel-essentials/medical-care.html |title=Medical Care in Ukraine. Health system, hospitals and clinics |publisher=BestOfUkraine.com |date=1 May 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}{{Dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public sector employs most healthcare professionals, with those working for private medical centres typically also retaining their state employment as they are mandated to provide care at public health facilities on a regular basis.

All of the country's medical service providers and hospitals are subordinate to the Ministry of Health, which provides oversight and scrutiny of general medical practice as well as being responsible for the day-to-day administration of the healthcare system. Despite this, standards of hygiene and patient-care have fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ukraine |url=http://www.europe-cities.com/en/633/ukraine/health/ |title=Health in Ukraine. Healthcare system of Ukraine |publisher=Europe-cities.com |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospitals in Ukraine are organised along the same lines as most European nations, according to the regional administrative structure; as a result most towns have their own hospital ''(&#x41C;&#x456;&#x441;&#x44C;&#x43A;&#x430; &#x41B;&#x456;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x440;&#x43D;&#x44F;)'' and many also have district hospitals ''(&#x420;&#x430;&#x439;&#x43E;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x430; &#x41B;&#x456;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x440;&#x43D;&#x44F;)''. Larger and more specialised medical complexes tend only to be found in major cities, with some even more specialised units located only in the capital, [[Kiev]]. However, all [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblasts]] have their own network of general hospitals which are able to deal with almost all medical problems and are typically equipped with major trauma centres; such hospitals are called 'regional hospitals' ''(&#x41E;&#x431;&#x43B;&#x430;&#x441;&#x43D;&#x430; &#x41B;&#x456;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x440;&#x43D;&#x44F;)''.

Ukraine currently faces a number of major public health issues and is considered to be in a demographic crisis due to its high death rate and low birth rate (the current Ukrainian birth rate is 11 births/1,000 population, and the death rate is 16.3 deaths/1,000 population). A factor contributing to the high death rate is a high [[mortality rate]] among working-age males from preventable causes such as [[alcohol poisoning]] and smoking.&lt;ref name="worldbank1"/&gt; In 2008, the country's population was one of the fastest declining in the world at &#x2212;5% growth.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/ |title=State Statistics Committee of Ukraine |publisher=Ukrstat.gov.ua |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN warned that Ukraine's population could fall by as much as 10 million by 2050 if trends did not improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/unpp/panel_population.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, obesity, systemic high blood pressure and the HIV endemic are all major challenges facing the Ukrainian healthcare system.

As of March 2009 the [[Ukrainian government]] is reforming the health care system, by the creation of a national network of [[family doctor]]s and improvements in the [[Emergency medical services|medical emergency services]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/11044/ National network of family doctors to be established by 2010, says health minister], [[Interfax|Interfax-Ukraine]] (30 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; former [[Ukrainian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] put forward (in November 2009) an idea to start introducing a public healthcare system based on health insurance in the spring of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/53483/ Ukraine to start introducing insurance-based healthcare system in spring of 2010], Kyiv Post (24 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{main|Education in Ukraine|List of universities in Ukraine}}
[[File:Universidad Roja de Kiev.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Kiev]] is one of Ukraine's most important educational institutions]]
[[File:Cernauti Residentia 04.jpg|thumbnail|[[Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans]] building by [[Josef Hl&#xE1;vka]], 1882, now [[Chernivtsi University]].]]
According to the [[Constitution of Ukraine|Ukrainian constitution]], access to free education is granted to all citizens. Complete general secondary education is compulsory in the state schools which constitute the overwhelming majority. Free higher education in state and communal educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rada.kiev.ua/const/conengl.htm|title=Constitution of Ukraine, Chapter 2, Article 53. Adopted at the Fifth Session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on 28 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a small number of accredited private secondary and higher education institutions.

Because of the Soviet Union's emphasis on total access of education for all citizens, which continues today, the [[literacy rate]] is an estimated 99.4%.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; Since 2005, an eleven-year school programme has been replaced with a twelve-year one: primary education takes four years to complete (starting at age six), middle education (secondary) takes five years to complete; upper secondary then takes three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/secondaryeduc_eng.html|title=General secondary education|accessdate=23 December 2007|publisher=Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20071016104343/http://education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/secondaryeduc_eng.html |archivedate = 16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th grade, students take Government tests, which are also referred to as school-leaving exams. These tests are later used for university admissions.

The first higher education institutions (HEIs) emerged in Ukraine during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The first Ukrainian higher education institution was the [[Ostroh Academy|Ostrozka School]], or Ostrozkiy Greek-Slavic-Latin Collegium, similar to Western European higher education institutions of the time. Established in 1576 in the town of [[Ostroh|Ostrog]], the Collegium was the first higher education institution in the [[East Slavic peoples|Eastern Slavic]] territories. The oldest university was the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kyiv Mohyla Academy]], first established in 1632 and in 1694 officially recognised by the government of [[Imperial Russia]] as a higher education institution. Among the oldest is also the [[Lviv University]], founded in 1661. More higher education institutions were set up in the 19th century, beginning with universities in [[Kharkiv University|Kharkiv]] (1805), [[Kiev University|Kiev]] (1834), [[Odessa University|Odessa]] (1865) and [[Chernivtsi University|Chernivtsi]] (1875) and a number of professional higher education institutions, e.g.: [[Nizhyn Pedagogical University|Nizhyn Historical and Philological Institute]] (originally established as the Gymnasium of Higher Sciences in 1805), a Veterinary Institute (1873) and a [[Kharkiv Polytechnical Institute|Technological Institute]] (1885) in [[Kharkiv]], a [[Kiev Polytechnic Institute|Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Kiev]] (1898) and a Higher Mining School (1899) in [[Dnipropetrovsk|Katerynoslav]]. Rapid growth followed in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet]] period. By 1988 a number of higher education institutions increased to 146 with over 850,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001465/146552e.pdf |title=Higher education in Ukraine; Monographs on higher education; 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most HEIs established after 1990 are those owned by private organisations.

The Ukrainian higher education system comprises higher educational establishments, [[scientific]] and [[methodological]] facilities under national, [[municipal government|municipal]] and self-governing bodies in charge of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/higher_educ_eng.html|title=System of Higher Education of Ukraine|accessdate=23 December 2007|publisher=Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20071217073746/http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/higher_educ_eng.html |archivedate = 17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation of higher education in Ukraine is built up in accordance with the structure of education of the world's higher [[developed countries]], as is defined by [[UNESCO]] and the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/education_eng.html |title=System of the Education of Ukraine|accessdate=23 December 2007|publisher=Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20071212111804/http://www.education.gov.ua/pls/edu/docs/common/education_eng.html |archivedate = 12 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ukraine has more than 800 higher education institutions and in 2010 the number of graduates reached 654,700 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outsourcing-ukraine.org/2011/10/14/educational-system-ukraine-facilitates-development-outsourcing-sector/ |title=Educational system in Ukraine |publisher=Outsourcing-ukraine.org |date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukraine produces the fourth largest number of [[Tertiary education|post-secondary graduates]] in Europe, while being ranked seventh in population.  [[Higher education in Ukraine|higher education]] is either state funded or private. Students that study at state expense receive a standard scholarship if their average marks at the end-of-term exams and differentiated test suffice; this rule may be different in some universities.  For highest grades, the scholarship is increased by 25%.  For most students the government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic living expenses.  Most universities provide subsidised housing for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students.  Ukrainian universities confer two degrees: the Bachelor's Degree (4&amp;nbsp;years) and the Master's Degree (5&#x2013;6th&amp;nbsp;year), in accordance with the [[Bologna process]].  Historically, [[Specialist degree]] (usually 5 years) is still also granted; it was the only degree awarded by universities in the Soviet times.

=== Regional differences ===
{{see also|Demographics of Ukraine#Regional differences|Central Ukraine|Eastern Ukraine|Southern Ukraine|Western Ukraine}}
[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is the dominant language in [[Western Ukraine]] and in [[Central Ukraine]], while [[Russian language|Russian]] is the dominant language in the cities of [[Eastern Ukraine]] and [[Southern Ukraine]]. In the [[Ukrainian SSR]] schools, learning [[Russian language|Russian]] was mandatory; currently in modern Ukraine, schools with Ukrainian as the language of instruction offer classes in Russian and in the other minority languages.&lt;ref name = "SerhyYUBoaMN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://norric.org/files/education-systems/Ukraine2009 | title = The Educational System of Ukraine | publisher = [[National Academic Recognition Information Centre]] |date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "RatingJuly12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/poll_ukrainian_language_prevails_at_home_229692 | title = Poll: Ukrainian language prevails at home | newspaper = [[Ukrinform]] | place = UA | date = 7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar historical cleavages also remain evident at the level of individual social identification.

The Communist era had quite a strong effect on the art and writing of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30078/Ukraine|title=Interwar Soviet Ukraine|accessdate=12 September 2007|work=[[Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica]] (fee required)|quote=In all, some four-fifths of the Ukrainian cultural elite was repressed or perished in the course of the 1930s}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Stalin made [[socialist realism]] state policy in the Soviet Union when he promulgated the decree "On the Reconstruction of Literary and Art Organisations".

The tradition of the [[Easter egg]], known as [[pysanky]], has long roots in Ukraine. These eggs were drawn on with wax to create a pattern; then, the dye was applied to give the eggs their pleasant colours, the dye did not affect the previously wax-coated parts of the egg. After the entire egg was dyed, the wax was removed leaving only the colourful pattern. This tradition is thousands of years old, and precedes the arrival of Christianity to Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.unc.edu/~yakowenk/pysanky/index.html|title=Pysanky &#x2013; Ukrainian Easter Eggs|accessdate=28 July 2008|publisher=[[University of North Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the city of [[Kolomyia]] near the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in 2000 was built the museum of Pysanka which won a nomination as the monument of modern Ukraine in 2007, part of the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]] action.

===Weaving and embroidery===
Artisan [[textile arts]] play an important role in Ukrainian culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ua-travelling.com/en/article/Ukrainian-clothes |title=Ukrainian folk dress. Traditional clothes of Ukraine |publisher=Ua-travelling.com |accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Ukrainian wedding traditions]]. [[Ukrainian embroidery]], [[weaving]] and lace-making are used in traditional [[folk dress]] and in traditional celebrations. Ukrainian embroidery varies depending on the region of origin&lt;ref&gt;''"Podvyzhnytsi narodnoho mystetstva", Kyiv 2003 and 2005, by Yevheniya Shudra, Welcome to Ukraine Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; and the designs have a long history of motifs, compositions, choice of colours and types of stitches.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional Ukrainian Embroidery|url=http://www.umacleveland.org/traditional-ukrainian-embroidery/|publisher=Ukrainian Museum-Archives|accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of color is very important and has roots in [[Ukrainian folklore]]. Embroidery motifs found in different parts of Ukraine are preserved in the [[Rushnyk]] Museum in [[Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi]].

National dress is woven and highly decorated. Weaving with handmade looms is still practised in the village of Krupove, situated in [[Rivne Oblast]]. The village is the birthplace of two famous personalities in the scene of national crafts fabrication.

[[File:Taras Shevchenko selfportrait oil 1840-2.jpg|thumbnail|[[Taras Shevchenko]] self-portrait.]]
The history of Ukrainian literature dates back to the 11th&amp;nbsp;century, following the Christianisation of the Kievan Rus'.&lt;ref name=ualit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/612921/Ukraine/30128/Daily-life-and-social-customs#toc275898|title=Ukraine &#x2013; Cultual Life &#x2013; The Arts &#x2013; Literature|accessdate=8 January 2014|work=[[Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of the time were mainly liturgical and were written in [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Historical accounts of the time were referred to as ''[[chronicle]]s'', the most significant of which was the [[Primary Chronicle]].&lt;ref name=ualitmsn&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573617_4/Ukraine.html|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080406035927/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573617_4/Ukraine.html|archivedate=6 April 2008 |title=Ukraine &#x2013; Literature |accessdate=3 July 2008 |work=MSN Encarta}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|G|g|none}} Literary activity faced a sudden decline during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']].&lt;ref name=ualit/&gt;

Ukrainian literature again began to develop in the 14th&amp;nbsp;century, and was advanced significantly in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century with the introduction of [[printing|print]] and with the beginning of the Cossack era, under both Russian and Polish dominance.&lt;ref name=ualit/&gt; The Cossacks established an independent society and popularized a [[Duma (epic)|new kind]] of [[epic poem]]s, which marked a high point of Ukrainian [[oral literature]].&lt;ref name=ualitmsn/&gt; These advances were then set back in the 17th and early 18th&amp;nbsp;centuries, when publishing in the Ukrainian language was outlawed and prohibited. Nonetheless, by the late 18th&amp;nbsp;century modern literary Ukrainian finally emerged.&lt;ref name=ualit/&gt;

The 19th&amp;nbsp;century initiated a [[vernacular]] period in Ukraine, led by [[Ivan Kotliarevsky]]'s work {{lang|uk-Latn|''Eneyida''}}, the first publication written in modern Ukrainian. By the 1830s, Ukrainian [[romanticism]] began to develop, and the nation's most renowned cultural figure, romanticist poet-painter [[Taras Shevchenko]] emerged. Where Ivan Kotliarevsky is considered to be the father of literature in the Ukrainian vernacular; Shevchenko is the father of a national revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\L\I\Literature.htm|title=Literature|author=Struk, Danylo Husar |accessdate=17 January 2008|work=Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 1863, use of the Ukrainian language in print was effectively [[Ems Ukaz|prohibited]] by the Russian Empire.&lt;ref name=censor/&gt; This severely curtailed literary activity in the area, and Ukrainian writers were forced to either publish their works in Russian or release them in Austrian controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. The ban was never officially lifted, but it became obsolete after the revolution and the Bolsheviks' coming to power.&lt;ref name=ualitmsn/&gt;

Ukrainian literature continued to flourish in the early Soviet years, when nearly all literary trends were approved (the most important literature figures of that time were [[Mykola Khvylovy]], [[Valerian Pidmohylny]], [[Mykola Kulish]], [[Mykhayl Semenko]] and some others). These policies faced a steep decline in the 1930s, when prominent representatives as well as many others were killed by NKVD (as part of [[Great Purge]]). In general around 223 writers were repressed (so called The [[Executed Renaissance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&#x42E;&#x440;&#x456;&#x439; &#x41B;&#x430;&#x432;&#x440;&#x456;&#x43D;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x43A;&#x43E; |url=http://fmm51.org.ua/html_books/lavrinenko_rozstriliane_vidrodzhennia.htm |title=&#x420;&#x43E;&#x437;&#x441;&#x442;&#x440;&#x456;&#x43B;&#x44F;&#x43D;&#x435; &#x432;&#x456;&#x434;&#x440;&#x43E;&#x434;&#x436;&#x435;&#x43D;&#x43D;&#x44F;: &#x410;&#x43D;&#x442;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x433;&#x456;&#x44F; 1917&#x2013;1933. |location=&#x41A;&#x438;&#x457;&#x432; |publisher=&#x421;&#x43C;&#x43E;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x43F; |date=2004|archivedate=13 December 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101213085603/http://fmm51.org.ua/html_books/lavrinenko_rozstriliane_vidrodzhennia.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This repressions were part of Stalin's implemented policy of [[socialist realism]]. The doctrine did not necessarily repress the Ukrainian language, but it required writers to follow a certain style in their works. 

In post-Stalinist times literary activities continued to be somewhat limited under the Communist Party. The most famous figures of Ukrainian post-war Soviet literature were [[Lina Kostenko]], [[Dmytro Pavlychko]], [[Borys Oliynyk]], [[Ivan Drach]], [[Oles Honchar]], [[Vasyl Stus]], [[Vasyl Symonenko]]. 

Literary freedom appeared in late 1980s &#x2014; early 1990s with the process of collapse of the USSR and reestablishing of Ukrainian independence in 1991.&lt;ref name=ualit/&gt; Among the most famous writers of the post-Soviet period are [[Oksana Zabuzhko]], [[Yurii Andrukhovych]], [[Oleksandr Irvanets]], [[Serhiy Zhadan]], [[Taras Prokhasko]], [[Yuriy Izdryk|Izdryk]], [[Yuri Pokalchuk|Yuriy Pokalchuk]], [[Yuriy Vynnychuk]], [[Andrey Kurkov]].&lt;ref&gt;Although Kurkov is writing in Russian he is mainly considered as a represtative of the Ukrainian literature.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Ukrainian architecture}}
[[File:Curitiba Parque Tingui.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional Ukrainian village [[Ukrainian architecture|architecture]] in [[Curitiba]], Brazil, where a large [[Ukrainian diaspora]] is.]]
Ukrainian architecture is a term that describes the motifs and styles that are found in structures built in modern Ukraine, and by [[Ukrainians]] worldwide.
These include initial roots which were established in the [[Eastern Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] state of [[Kievan Rus']]. After the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|12th century]], the distinct [[architectural history]] continued in the principalities of [[Galicia-Volhynia]]. During the epoch of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], a new style unique to Ukraine was developed under the western influences of the [[Polish&#x2013;Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. After the union with the [[Tsardom of Russia]], architecture in Ukraine began to develop in different directions, with many structures in the larger eastern, Russian-ruled area built in the styles of [[Russian architecture]] of that period, whilst the western [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] was developed under [[Architecture of Austria|Austro-Hungarian architectural influences]], in both cases producing fine examples.&lt;!-- pov, but for now we can afford to leave it in --&gt; Ukrainian national motifs would finally be used during the period of the [[Soviet Union]] and in modern independent Ukraine.

The great [[Architecture of Kievan Rus|churches of the Rus']], built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. The architectural style of the Kievan state was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly made of wood, with the simplest form of church becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of the appearance of pre-Christian pagan Slavic temples.

Several examples of these churches survive; however, during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, many were externally rebuilt in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style (see below). Examples include the grand [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|St. Sophia of Kiev]] &#x2013; the year 1017 is the earliest record of foundation laid, [[Church of the Saviour at Berestove]] &#x2013; built from 1113 to 1125 and [[St. Cyril's Monastery|St. Cyril's Church]], circa 12th-century. All can still be found in the Ukrainian capital. Several buildings were reconstructed during the late-19th century, including the [[:File:WladimirWolynsk Uspenski Cathedral.jpeg|Assumption Cathedral]] in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], built in 1160 and reconstructed in 1896&#x2013;1900, the [[:File:AX Chernigiv Pyatnitska Church.jpg|Paraskevi church in Chernihiv]], built in 1201 with reconstruction done in the late 1940s, and the [[Golden Gate (Kiev)|Golden gates in Kiev]], built in 1037 and reconstructed in 1982. The latter's reconstruction was criticised by some art and architecture historians as a revivalist fantasy. Unfortunately little secular or [[vernacular architecture]] of [[Kievan Rus']] has survived.

As Ukraine became increasingly integrated into the [[Russian Empire]], Russian architects had the opportunity to realise their projects in the picturesque landscape that many Ukrainian cities and regions offered. [[St. Andrew's Church of Kiev]] (1747&#x2013;1754), built by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], is a notable example of [[Baroque]] architecture, and its location on top of the Kievan mountain made it a recognisable monument of the city. An equally notable contribution of Rasetrelli was the [[Mariyinsky Palace]], which was built to be a summer residence to Russian Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]]. During the reign of the last [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman of Ukraine]], [[Kirill Razumovsky]], many of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]'s towns such as [[Hlukhiv]], [[Baturyn]] and [[Koselets]] had grandiose projects built by [[Andrey Kvasov]]. Russia eventually conquered the south of Ukraine and Crimea, and renamed them as [[New Russia]].  New cities such as [[Mykolayiv|Nikolayev]], [[Odessa]], [[Kherson]] and [[Sevastopol]] were founded. These would contain notable examples of Imperial Russian architecture.

In 1934, the capital of Soviet Ukraine moved from [[Kharkiv]] to [[Kiev]]. Previously, the city was seen as only a regional centre, hence received little attention. All of that was to change, at great price. The first examples of [[Stalinist architecture]] were already showing, and, in light of the official policy, a new city was to be built on top of the old one. This meant that much-admired examples such as the [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] were destroyed. Even the St. Sophia Cathedral was under threat. Also, the Second World War contributed to the wreckage. After the war, a new project for the reconstruction of central Kiev transformed [[Khreshchatyk]] avenue into a notable example of Stalinism in Architecture. However, by 1955, the new politics of architecture once again stopped the project from fully being realised.

The task for modern Ukrainian architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. An example of modern Ukrainian architecture is the reconstruction and renewal of the [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] in central Kiev. Despite the limit set by narrow space within the plaza, the engineers were able to blend together the uneven landscape, and use underground space for a new shopping centre.

A major project, which may take up most of the 21st century, is the construction of the Kiev City-Centre on the [[Rybalskyi Peninsula]], which, when finished, will include a dense skyscraper park amid the picturesque landscape of the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archunion.com.ua/sovet-2005/gradsovet_05_12_07.shtml|title=Project of reconstruction of the Rybalskyi Peninsula|work=archunion.com.ua|date=7 December 2005|accessdate=8 January 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Music of Ukraine}}
Music is a major part of Ukrainian culture, with a long history and many influences. From traditional [[folk music]], to [[classical music|classical]] and [[modern rock]], Ukraine has produced several internationally recognised musicians including [[Kirill Karabits]], [[Okean Elzy]] and [[Ruslana]]. Elements from traditional Ukrainian folk music made their way into Western music and even into [[modern jazz]].

Ukraine music sometimes presents a perplexing mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony.
The most striking general characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian folk music is the wide use of minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals.

During the Baroque period, music was an important discipline for those that had received a higher education in Ukraine. It had a place of considerable importance in the curriculum of the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]. Much of the nobility was well versed in music with many Ukrainian Cossack leaders such as (Mazepa, Paliy, Holovatyj, Sirko) being accomplished players of the [[kobza]], [[bandura]] or [[torban]].

The first dedicated musical academy was set up in Hlukhiv, Ukraine in 1738 and students were taught to sing, play violin and bandura from manuscripts. As a result many of the earliest composers and performers within the Russian empire were ethnically Ukrainian, having been born or educated in Hlukhiv, or had been closely associated with this music school.
See: [[Dmytro Bortniansky]], [[Maksym Berezovsky]] and [[Artemy Vedel|Artemiy Vedel]].

Ukrainian classical music falls into three distinct categories defined by whether the composer was of Ukrainian ethnicity living in Ukraine, a composer of non-Ukrainian ethnicity who was born or at some time was a citizen of Ukraine, or an ethnic Ukrainian living outside of Ukraine within the [[Ukrainian diaspora]]. The music of these three groups differs considerably, as do the audiences for whom they cater.

Since the mid-1960s, Western-influenced pop music has been growing in popularity in Ukraine. Folk singer and harmonium player [[Mariana Sadovska]] is prominent. Ukrainian pop and folk music arose with the international popularity of groups and performers like [[Vopli Vidoplyasova]], [[Dakh Daughters]], [[Ivan Dorn]] and [[Okean Elzy]].

===Cinema===

{{Main|Cinema of Ukraine}}
Ukraine has had an influence on the history of the cinema. Ukrainian directors [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], often cited as one of the most important early Soviet filmmakers, as well as being a pioneer of [[Soviet montage theory]], [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]], and [[Sergei Parajanov]], Armenian film director and artist who made significant contributions to Ukrainian, Armenian and Georgian cinema. He invented his own cinematic style, Ukrainian poetic cinema, which was totally out of step with the guiding principles of socialist realism.

Other important directors including [[Kira Muratova]], [[Larisa Shepitko]], [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], [[Leonid Bykov]], [[Yuri Ilyenko]], [[Leonid Osyka]], [[Ihor Podolchak]] with his [[Delirium (2013 film)|Delirium]] and [[Maryna Vroda]]. Many Ukrainian actors have achieved international fame and critical success, including: [[Vera Kholodnaya]], [[Bohdan Stupka]], [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mila Kunis]].

Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of Russian and European influence. Ukrainian producers are active in international co-productions and Ukrainian actors, directors and crew feature regularly in Russian (Soviet in past) films. Also successful films have been based on Ukrainian people, stories or events, including [[Battleship Potemkin]], [[Man with a Movie Camera]], [[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]]. The highest-grossing film ever is [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]] with &#xA3;5.2 million in 2009.

Ukrainian State Film Agency owns [[National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre]], film copying laboratory and archive, takes part in hosting of the [[Odessa International Film Festival]], and [[Molodist]] is the only one [[FIAPF]] accredited International Film Festival held in Ukraine; competition program is devoted to student, first short and first full feature films from all over the world. Held annually in October.

{{Main|Media of Ukraine}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Ukrainian Week 5.jpg|thumbnail|[[The Ukrainian Week]] January 2014 cover]] --&gt;
[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]&lt;ref name="alexa.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/UA |title=Top Sites in Ukraine |publisher=Alexa |accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Georgiy Gongadze]] in April 2000 (the day of the Ukrainian constitutional referendum). Published mainly in Ukrainian with selected articles published in or translated to Russian and English, the newspaper has particular emphasis on the politics of Ukraine. Freedom of the press in Ukraine is considered to be among the freest of the post-Soviet states other than the Baltic states.
[[Freedom House]] classifies the Internet in Ukraine as "free" and the press as "partly free". Press freedom has significantly improved since the Orange Revolution of 2004. However, in 2010 Freedom House perceived "negative trends in Ukraine".

[[Kyiv]] dominates the media sector in Ukraine: the [[Kyiv Post]] is Ukraine's leading English-language newspaper. National [[List of newspapers in Ukraine|newspapers]] [[Den (newspaper)|Den]], [[Zerkalo Nedeli|Mirror Weekly]], tabloids, such as [[The Ukrainian Week]] or [[Focus (Ukrainian magazine)|Focus]] (Russian), and television and radio are largely based there, although [[Lviv]] is also a significant national media centre. The National News Agency of Ukraine, [[Ukrinform]] was founded here in 1918. The Ukraine publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover. [[Sanoma]] publishing Ukrainian editions of such magazines as [[Esquire]], [[Harpers Bazaar]] and [[National Geographic Magazine]]. [[BBC Ukrainian]] started its broadcasts in 1992.

Ukrainians listen to radio programming, such as [[Radio Ukraine]] or [[Radio Liberty]], largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day. Several television channels operate, and many Websites are popular.

Ukraine greatly benefited from the Soviet emphasis on [[physical education]]. Such policies left Ukraine with hundreds of stadia, swimming pools, gymnasia and many other athletic facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30127/Ukraine|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080115053121/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30127/Ukraine|archivedate=15 January 2008 |title=Ukraine &#x2013; Sports and recreation|accessdate=12 January 2008|work=Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica (fee required)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular sport is [[Association football|football]]. The top professional league is the [[Ukrainian Premier League|Vyscha Liha]] ("premier league").

Many Ukrainians also played for the [[Soviet national football team]], most notably [[Ihor Belanov]] and [[Oleh Blokhin]], winners of the prestigious [[Ballon d'Or|Golden Ball Award]]. This award was only presented to one Ukrainian after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, [[Andriy Shevchenko]]. The national team made its debut in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], and reached the quarterfinals before losing to eventual champions, [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. Ukrainians also fared well in [[boxing]], where the brothers [[Vitali Klitschko|Vitali]] and [[Wladimir Klitschko]] have held world heavyweight championships.

[[Sergey Bubka]] held the record in the [[Pole vault]] from 1993 to 2014; with great strength, speed and gymnastic abilities, he was voted the world's best athlete on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympic.org/en/content/The-IOC/Members/Mr-Sergey-BUBKA/ | accessdate =27 May 2010 | title = Mr. Sergey BUBKA | author = International Olympic Committee | work = Official website of the Olympic Movement | quote =...&amp;nbsp;voted world's best athlete on several occasions. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trackandfieldnews.com/archive/aoy.html |title=Track and Field Athlete of the Year |publisher=Trackandfieldnews.com |accessdate=30 January 2011}}{{Dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basketball]] is becoming popular in Ukraine. In 2011, Ukraine was granted a right to organize [[EuroBasket 2015]]. Two years later the [[Ukraine national basketball team]] finished 6th in [[EuroBasket 2013]] and qualified to [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup|FIBA World Cup]] for the first time in its history. [[Euroleague]] participant [[BC Budivelnyk|Budivelnyk Kyiv]] is the strongest professional basketball club in Ukraine.

[[Chess]] is a popular sport in Ukraine. [[Ruslan Ponomariov]] is the former world champion. There are about 85 [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmasters]] and 198 [[International Masters]] in Ukraine.
