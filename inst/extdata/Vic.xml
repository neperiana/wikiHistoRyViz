The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The Plana de Vic (Vic plain) is home to a thriving pig farming industry in which millions of pigs from Northern Europe are fattened up before being shipped back to their countries of origin. The origin of this trade lies partly in more stringent environmental standards in countries such as The Netherlands and Denmark. Little thought has been given to the environmental impact of such a large number of livestock in a relatively small area. The result is nitrate pollution of aquifers from pig slurry. Most slurry is simply spread on fields or, worse, dumped along river banks. The Catalan government's unwillingness to put public health before the powerful pig lobby's interests resulted in a stiff fine from the European Commission. Unfortunately, the problem is far from being solved.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].
It is located at 484 metres above the sea. Population 30,397 (1996).

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The tradition of making cured sausages and cold meats owes its origins to the Plana de Vic's traditional pig farming activities. However, the livestock industry has grown out of all recognition during the last couple of decades and millions of pigs from Northern Europe are fattened up here before being shipped back to their countries of origin. The reasons for this trade partly lie in more stringent environmental standards in countries such as The Netherlands and Denmark. Little thought has been given in Catalonia to the environmental impact of such large numbers of livestock in a relatively small area. The result (as in The Netherlands during the 1970s) is massive nitrate pollution of aquifers from pig slurry. Most slurry is simply spread on fields or, in some cases, dumped along water courses. The Catalan government's unwillingness to put public health before the powerful pig lobby's interests resulted in a stiff fine from the European Commission. Unfortunately, the problem is still far from being solved. 

The bucolic landscape of the county described by Jacinct Verdaguer (a famous 19th century poet born near Vic) is also fast disappearing as local villages and towns vie with one another to build industrial estates. Environmental threats are also posed by local factories, not least because the area is famed for its temperature inversions (these effectively blanket in pollution). A scheme to build a massive incinerator at nearby Sant Pere de Torell&#xF3; to burn 90,000 metric tonnes of industrial waste a year is unlikely to improve matters.  

Vic lay in the "desert" that separated Frankish and Islamic forces in the Spanish [[Marches]] of the 8th and 9th centuries. At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

The city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], king of Spain, in the [[18th century]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].
It is located at 484 metres above the sea. Population 30,397 (1996).

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The tradition of making cured sausages and cold meats owes its origins to the Plana de Vic's traditional pig farming activities. However, the livestock industry has grown out of all recognition during the last couple of decades and millions of pigs from Northern Europe are fattened up here before being shipped back to their countries of origin. The reasons for this trade partly lie in more stringent environmental standards in countries such as [[The Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]]. Little thought has been given in [[Catalonia]] to the environmental impact of such large numbers of livestock in a relatively small area. The result (as in The Netherlands during the 1970s) is massive [[nitrate pollution]] of aquifers from pig slurry. Most slurry is simply spread on fields or, in some cases, dumped along water courses. The Catalan government's unwillingness to put public health before the powerful pig lobby's interests resulted in a stiff fine from the European Commission. Unfortunately, the problem is still far from being solved. 

The bucolic landscape of the county described by [[Jacinct Verdaguer]] (a famous 19th century poet born near Vic) is also fast disappearing as local villages and towns vie with one another to build industrial estates. Environmental threats are also posed by local factories, not least because the area is famed for its temperature inversions (these effectively blanket in pollution). A scheme to build a massive [[incinerator]] at nearby [[Sant Pere de Torell&#xF3;]] to burn 90,000 metric tonnes of industrial waste a year is unlikely to improve matters.  

Vic lay in the "desert" that separated Frankish and Islamic forces in the Spanish [[Marches]] of the 8th and 9th centuries. At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

The city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], king of Spain, in the [[18th century]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].
It is located at 484 metres above the sea. Population 30,397 (1996).

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming. However, the livestock industry has grown by leaps and bounds over the last couple of decades and millions of pigs from Northern Europe are now fattened up here before being shipped back to their countries of origin. The reasons for this trade partly lie in more stringent environmental standards in countries such as [[The Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]]. Little thought has been given in [[Catalonia]] to the environmental impact of such large numbers of livestock in a relatively small area. The result (as in The Netherlands during the 1970s) is massive nitrate pollution of aquifers from pig slurry. Much of this muck is simply spread on fields (an unwise practice given the prevailing dry climate) or, in some cases, dumped along water courses. The Catalan government's unwillingness to put public health before the powerful pig lobby's interests resulted in a stiff fine from the [[European Commission]]. Unfortunately, the problem is still far from being solved. 

The county's striking landscape - so beautifully described by the Rev. Jacinct Verdaguer (a famous 19th century poet born near Vic) - is also fast disappearing as local villages and towns vie with one another to build sprawling industrial estates. Environmental threats are also posed by local factories, not least because of the area's frequent temperature inversions, which blanket in pollution. A scheme to build a massive incinerator [http://www.valldelges.net/en] at nearby [[Sant Pere de Torell&#xF3;]] to burn 90,000 metric tonnes of industrial waste a year is unlikely to improve matters.  

Vic lay in the "desert" that separated Frankish and Islamic forces in the Spanish [[Marches]] of the 8th and 9th centuries. At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

The city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], king of Spain, in the [[18th century]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

Vic is also the nickname of a prominent artist and singer named Victorie Rune.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].

==History==
During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a muslim incrusion and repopulated by [[Gifr&#xE9; el Pel&#xF3;s]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], King of Spain. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In [[1992]] Vic hold the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museu dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Specially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
Textile industry, now almost disappeared, had been the first industrial and commercial activity of the city for centuries. Nowadays, agriculture, construction and food commerce activities are the pillars of its economy.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].

==History==
During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a muslim incrusion and repopulated by [[Gifr&#xE9; el Pel&#xF3;s]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], King of Spain. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In [[1992]] Vic hold the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museu dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Specially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
Textile industry, now almost disappeared, had been the first industrial and commercial activity of the city for centuries. Nowadays, agriculture, construction and food commerce activities are the pillars of its economy.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].

==History==
During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a muslim incrusion and repopulated by [[Gifr&#xE9; el Pel&#xF3;s]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], King of Spain. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In [[1992]] Vic hold the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museu dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Specially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].

==History==
During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a muslim incrusion and repopulated by [[Gifr&#xE9; el Pel&#xF3;s]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], King of Spain. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In [[1992]] Vic hold the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].

==History==
During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a muslim incrusion and repopulated by [[Gifr&#xE9; el Pel&#xF3;s]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], King of Spain. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In [[1992]] Vic hold the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museu dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Specially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion and repopulated by [[Gifr&#xE9; el Pel&#xF3;s]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], King of Spain. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion and repopulated by [[Gifr&#xE9; el Pel&#xF3;s]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], King of Spain. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

'''Vic''' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]; '''Vich''' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion and repopulated by [[Gifr&#xE9; el Pel&#xF3;s]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], King of Spain. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==History==
Vic(h) is of very ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  
The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' it Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vich was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Gifr&#xE9; el Pel&#xF3;s]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], King of Spain. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 
 
The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vich is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vich was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of Ripoli, which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vich. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vich was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besahi]], and Abbot of Ripoli where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vich, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vich, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoli, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vich an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vich was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of San Pedro Ap&#xF3;stol or S. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of San Pedro.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillermo Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pedro Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jorge (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoli and also consecrated that of S. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimundo de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of San Juan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernardo Despujol. Among the chapels that of S. Bernardo Calvo (1233-43), who assisted [[Jaime I]] in the conquest of [[Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Munoz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Mos&#xE9;n Jacinto Verdager]], author of "La Atlantida". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vich. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cueva, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vich never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vich of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vich by a Catholic Congress.
 
As other celebrated natives of Vich should be mentioned the [[Trinitarian]] [[St. Miguel de los Santos]] and Padre Claret, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' it Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vich was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Gifr&#xE9; el Pel&#xF3;s]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], King of Spain. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 
 
The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vich is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vich was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of Ripoli, which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vich. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vich was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besahi]], and Abbot of Ripoli where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vich, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vich, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoli, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vich an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vich was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of San Pedro Ap&#xF3;stol or S. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of San Pedro.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillermo Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pedro Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jorge (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoli and also consecrated that of S. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimundo de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of San Juan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernardo Despujol. Among the chapels that of S. Bernardo Calvo (1233-43), who assisted [[Jaime I]] in the conquest of [[Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Munoz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Mos&#xE9;n Jacinto Verdager]], author of "La Atlantida". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vich. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cueva, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vich never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vich of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vich by a Catholic Congress.
 
As other celebrated natives of Vich should be mentioned the [[Trinitarian]] [[St. Miguel de los Santos]] and Padre Claret, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

'''Vic''' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]; '''Vich''' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of Ripoli, which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vich. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vich was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besahi]], and Abbot of Ripoli where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vich, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vich, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoli, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vich an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vich was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of San Pedro Ap&#xF3;stol or S. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of San Pedro.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillermo Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pedro Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jorge (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoli and also consecrated that of S. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimundo de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of San Juan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernardo Despujol. Among the chapels that of S. Bernardo Calvo (1233-43), who assisted [[Jaime I]] in the conquest of [[Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Munoz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Mos&#xE9;n Jacinto Verdager]], author of "La Atlantida". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vich. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cueva, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vich never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vich of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vich by a Catholic Congress.
 
Other celebrated natives of Vich include:
*[[Trinitarian]] [[St. Miguel de los Santos]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], born in Vich, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and 
*Padre Claret, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

'''Vic''' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]; '''Vich''' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic(h) is of very ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  
The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' it Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vich was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Gifr&#xE9; el Pel&#xF3;s]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 
 
The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vich is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vich was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

He restored the monastery of Ripoli, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Padre [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of San Pedro Ap&#xF3;stol or S. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of San Pedro.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillermo Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pedro Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jorge (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoli and also consecrated that of S. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimundo de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of San Juan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernardo Despujol. Among the chapels that of S. Bernardo Calvo (1233-43), who assisted [[Jaime I]] in the conquest of [[Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Munoz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Mos&#xE9;n Jacinto Verdager]], author of "La Atlantida". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vich. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cueva, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vich never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vich of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vich by a Catholic Congress.
 
Other celebrated natives of Vich include:
*[[Trinitarian]] [[St. Miguel de los Santos]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], born in Vich, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic is of very ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  
The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' it Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 
 
The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vich is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vich was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of Ripoli, which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vich. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besahi]], and Abbot of Ripoli where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoli, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillermo Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pedro Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jorge (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoli and also consecrated that of S. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimundo de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of San Juan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernardo Despujol. Among the chapels that of S. Bernardo Calvo (1233-43), who assisted [[Jaime I]] in the conquest of [[Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Munoz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Mos&#xE9;n Jacinto Verdager]], author of "La Atlantida". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vich. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cueva, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vich never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vich of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vich by a Catholic Congress.
 
Other celebrated natives of Vich include:

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic is of very ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  
The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' it Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 
 
The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Padre [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cueva, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic is of very ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  
The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' it Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 
 
The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Padre [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of San Pedro Ap&#xF3;stol or S. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of San Pedro.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillermo Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pedro Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jorge (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoli and also consecrated that of S. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimundo de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of San Juan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernardo Despujol. Among the chapels that of S. Bernardo Calvo (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Munoz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cueva, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' (previously known as '''Vich''' in pre-normative [[Catalan language]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].

'''Vic''' (previously known as '''Vich''' in pre-normative [[Catalan language]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic is of very ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  
The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' it Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 
 
The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Padre [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of San Pedro Ap&#xF3;stol or S. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of San Pedro.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillermo Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pedro Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jorge (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoli and also consecrated that of S. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimundo de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of San Juan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernardo Despujol. Among the chapels that of S. Bernardo Calvo (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Munoz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cueva, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.
 
Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian]] [[St. Miguel de los Santos]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vic''' (previously known as '''Vich''' in pre-normative [[Catalan language]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic is of very ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  
The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' it Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Padre [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of San Pedro Ap&#xF3;stol or S. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of San Pedro.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillermo Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pedro Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jorge (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoli and also consecrated that of S. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimundo de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of San Juan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernardo Despujol. Among the chapels that of S. Bernardo Calvo (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Munoz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cueva, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.
 
Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian]] [[St. Miguel de los Santos]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814-1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vic''' (previously known as '''Vich''' in pre-normative [[Catalan language]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic is of very ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  
The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' it Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Padre [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.
 
Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian]] [[St. Miquel dels Sants]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814-1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' it Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then forth, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Padre [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.
 
Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian]] [[St. Miquel dels Sants]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814-1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vic''' (previously known as '''Vich''' in pre-normative [[Catalan language]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&#xB2;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Padre [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.
 
Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian]] [[St. Miquel dels Sants]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814-1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vic''' (previously known as '''Vich''' in pre-normative [[Catalan language]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&#xB2;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic is of very ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  
The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned.

In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Padre [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.
 
Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian]] [[St. Miquel dels Sants]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814-1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vic''' (previously known as '''Vich''' in pre-normative [[Catalan language]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&#xB2;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic is of very ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  
The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038.

Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Padre [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.
 
Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian]] [[St. Miquel dels Sants]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814-1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vic''' (previously known as '''Vich''' in pre-normative [[Catalan language]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&#xB2;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  
The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne.

For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' (previously known as '''Vich''' in pre-normative [[Catalan language]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&#xB2;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  
The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. 
In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Padre [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' (previously known as '''Vich''' in pre-normative [[Catalan language]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&#xB2;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*[[Joseph Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781.

'''Vic''' (previously known as '''Vich''' in pre-normative [[Catalan language]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' (comparable to a  [[county]] or [[shire]]) of [[Osona]], in the province of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its population is approximately 36,571 (2004) with an area of 30.92 km&#xB2;; elevation above sea level is 484 m. Its geographic location, only 69 km from [[Barcelona]] and 60 km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central [[Catalonia]].  On December 22, 2005, the city won a total of 2.4 billion [[euro]] in lottery money ([http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html]).

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin; it was called '''Ausa''' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' (also known as '''Vich''' in old [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin; it was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare. 

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. 

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.
 
The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].
 
In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona. 

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.
 
Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.
 
Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.
 
Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado. 

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.
 
The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.
 
The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved. 

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.
 
Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.
 
The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' (also known as '''Vich''' in old [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin; it was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' (also known as '''Vich''' in old [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin; it was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' (also known as '''Vich''' in old [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin; it was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' (also known as '''Vich''' in old [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin; it was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans, and Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' (also known as '''Vich''' in old [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' (also known as '''Vich''' in old [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Orleans, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Gerona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lerida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Gerona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;|Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very remote, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.

*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the bishop of Vic.

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].

The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rotonda was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city burrough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the bishop of Vic.

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jose Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jose Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jos&#xE9; Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jos&#xE9; Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the bishop of Vic.

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jos&#xE9; Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese.

*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jos&#xE9; Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jos&#xE9; Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Mar&#xED;a Claret i Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the bishop of Vic.

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese.

Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the bishop of Vic.

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Jos&#xE9; Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Jos&#xE9; Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antonio Mar&#xED;a Claret y Clar&#xE1;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernard Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernard Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaime Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. Its geographic location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km from [[Barcelona]] and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made the city one of the most important of central Catalonia.  On [[2005-12-22]], the inhabitants of the city won about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the bishop of Vic.

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Spain]].  

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded.

[[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Spain]].  

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Gerona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. The geographic situation, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has done Vic one of the most important cities in central Catalonia.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. The geographic situation, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has done Vic one of the most important cities in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

[[Image:Templo romano de Vic.jpg|thumb|230px|Roman temple]]

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. The geographic situation, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has done Vic one of the most important cities in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

[[Image:Templo romano de Vic.jpg|thumb|230px|Roman temple]]

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. The geographic situation, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made Vic one of the most important cities in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

[[Image:Templo romano de Vic.jpg|thumb|230px|Roman temple]]

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. The geographic situation, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made Vic one of the most important cities in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in [[788]] during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in [[878]] who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In [[1992]] Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta.

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. The geographic situation, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made Vic one of the most important cities in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In 1992 Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. The geographic situation, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made Vic one of the most important cities in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In 1992 Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]

On [[2005-12-22]], some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. The geographic situation, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made Vic one of the most important cities in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In 1992 Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. The geographic situation, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made Vic one of the most important cities in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In 1992 Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

[[Image:Templo romano de Vic.jpg|thumb|230px|Roman temple]]

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. The geographic situation, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made Vic one of the most important cities in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived, when it was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of king [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century it had 9500 inhabitants. In 1992 Vic held the [[Roller Hockey]] events of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] of Barcelona.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated to the Blessed Virgin the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]], which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the Vic plain's long tradition of pig farming.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

[[Image:Templo romano de Vic.jpg|thumb|230px|Roman temple]]

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitantsm, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

[[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous== 
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[2005-12-22]], some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded.

In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

[[Image:Templo romano de Vic.jpg|thumb|230px|Roman temple]]

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].:(

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69 km far from Barcelona and 60 km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.


==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta.

The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[2005-12-22]], some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

[[Image:Templo romano de Vic.jpg|thumb|230px|Roman temple]]

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==
Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other celebrated natives of Vic diocese include:
*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]].
*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva.

It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018-46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Sights and monuments==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233-43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik|IPA}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik|IPA}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik|IPA}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik|IPA}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]].

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik|IPA}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik|IPA}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

[[Image:Templo romano de Vic.jpg|thumb|230px|Roman temple]]

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona (province)|province of Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].

The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of anal origin. Vic, in bed, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans. This means anal invader from the North. You will feel pain, your vision will blur, you will be Vic'd. Iberian coins bearing his name have been found inside the pockets of young children.  The [[Visigoths]] called him '''Ausona''' (boytoy).

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

==Gaystory==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Fag'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''what's that smell in his hair?'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces.He fingered his ass cus victoria wasnt here yet to do it for him. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion,because he didnt wash his hair for about 3 centuries. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vic is not attractive'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of his asshole. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic's green lantern penis]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from Girona, has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], and dispute the main League [[OK Liga]].

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].

*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], and dispute the main League [[OK Liga]].

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].
Vic is also the name of a student at FHS. his name is Vic Setlur.

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], and dispute the main League [[OK Liga]].

As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], and dispute the main League [[OK Liga]].

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], and dispute the main League [[OK Liga]].

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915- 38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607-1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607-1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2005-12-22, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2005, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], and dispute the main League [[OK Liga]].

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous monastery of [[Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the nineteenth century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2005, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]].

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2005, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], and dispute the main League [[OK Liga]].

In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which resulted in Catalonia losing its freedom as a nation.

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2005, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], and dispute the main League [[OK Liga]].

In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of Sta. Maria de Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

::*See also [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic]]

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2005, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], in the main league, the [[OK Liga]].

As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
{{main|Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic}}
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral.

The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
{{main|Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic}}
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop Atton (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2005, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], in the main league, the [[OK Liga]].

As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
{{main|Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic}}
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop [[Atto (bishop of Vic)|Atton]] (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop [[Jordi (bishop of Vic)|Jordi]] (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral.

It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian.

The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
{{main|Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic}}
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop [[Atto (bishop of Vic)|Atton]] (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop [[Jordi (bishop of Vic)|Jordi]] (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2005, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], in the main league, the [[OK Liga]].

Bishop [[Jordi (bishop of Vic)|Jordi]] (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:

[[Image:Templo romano de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|230px|Roman temple]]

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
{{main|Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic}}
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop [[Atto (bishop of Vic)|Atton]] (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop [[Jordi (bishop of Vic)|Jordi]] (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
{{main|Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic}}
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop [[Atto (bishop of Vic)|Atton]] (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop [[Jordi (bishop of Vic)|Jordi]] (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2005, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], in the main league, the [[OK Liga]].

*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop [[Jordi (bishop of Vic)|Jordi]] (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

[[Image:Templo romano de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|230px|Roman temple]]

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==Geography==
It lies in the middle of a plain with itself name, Plain Vic equidistant from Barcelona and the Pyrenees.

     Altitude: 499 m
     Latitude: 41 &#xBA; 55 '52 "N
     Length: 002&#xBA; 15 '21 "E

It is famous for its persistent Fog in winter as a result of a persistent thermal inversion with lows temperatures up to -10 &#xB0; C and an absolute record of -24 &#xBA;. Episodes of cold and severe snowstorms are noticeable. In summer storms are very common investing the dry season typical of the mediterranean climate of coastal Catalonia. Fot that reason the natural vegetation includes the pubescent oak typical of the submediterranean climates of eastern France, Northern Italy and the Balkans.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
{{main|Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic}}
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop [[Atto (bishop of Vic)|Atton]] (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
{{main|Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic}}
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop [[Atto (bishop of Vic)|Atton]] (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop [[Jordi (bishop of Vic)|Jordi]] (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2005, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], in the main league, the [[OK Liga]].

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
{{main|Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic}}
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop [[Atto (bishop of Vic)|Atton]] (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop [[Jordi (bishop of Vic)|Jordi]] (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2005, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], in the main league, the [[OK Liga]].

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==Geography==
It lies in the middle of a plain with itself name, Plain Vic equidistant from Barcelona and the Pyrenees.

     Altitude: 499 m
     Latitude: 41 &#xBA; 55 '52 "N
     Length: 002&#xBA; 15 '21 "E

It is famous for its persistent Fog in winter as a result of a persistent thermal inversion with lows temperatures up to -10 &#xB0; C and an absolute record of -24 &#xBA;. Episodes of cold and severe snowstorms are noticeable. In summer storms are very common investing the dry season typical of the mediterranean climate of coastal Catalonia. Fot that reason the natural vegetation includes the pubescent oak typical of the submediterranean climates of eastern France, Northern Italy and the Balkans.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
{{main|Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic}}
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop [[Atto (bishop of Vic)|Atton]] (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop [[Jordi (bishop of Vic)|Jordi]] (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. Vic, in past times, was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
{{main|Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic}}
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was undoubtedly very early, as martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of [[Emperor Decius]], and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the Bishop of Vic is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop [[Atto (bishop of Vic)|Atton]] (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

*Other celebrated natives of the Vic diocese include:

::*Saint [[Antoni Maria Claret i Clar&#xE0;]], archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] and founder of the [[Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in [[North America]] also known as the [[Claretians]].

::*Archbishop [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany|Josep Sadoc Alemany i Concill]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and first [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Francisco|archbishop of San Francisco, California]].

==Culture==
[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop [[Jordi (bishop of Vic)|Jordi]] (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2005, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005. Archived on the [[Internet Archive]] January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
The city has a [[roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] team, [[CHP Vic]], one of the most important in [[Spain]], in the main league, the [[OK Liga]].

None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when [[Cinidius of Vic|Cinidius]] is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589&#x2013;99) attended the [[third Council of Toledo]]; Esteban, the fourth and one at [[Egara]]; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of [[Louis the Pious]], who confided the civil government to [[Borrell of Ausona|Borrell, Count of Ausona]], all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the [[Archbishop of Narbonne]].

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by [[Wilfred the Hairy]], independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the famous [[monastery of Ripoll]] to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his rights to the king, [[James II of Aragon|James II]], who also purchased the rights of the Moncadas.

Bishop [[Atto (bishop of Vic)|Atton]] (960&#x2013;72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of education. Many persons availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the monk of Aurillac, afterwards [[Pope Sylvester II]], who was distinguished for his learning.

Another of the most illustrious bishops of Vic was [[Abbot Oliva|Oliva]] (1018&#x2013;46), son of the Count of [[Besal&#xFA;]], and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the relics of its [[patron saint]]s, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of [[Archbishop of Tarragona]], which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the [[Council of Trent]] was [[Acisclo Moya de Contreras]], Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian [[Pedro Mercado]].

Of the more recent bishops, Josep Morgades i Gili deserves special mention. He restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torres i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

[[File:UniversitatVic.jpg|thumb|[[Vic University]]]]
Among other centers and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic is renowned for:
*The ''[[Universitat de Vic]]'', a young but active University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The ''[[Museu episcopal]]'', a medieval art museum administered by the [[Diocese|bishopric]].
*The ''[[Museu de la pell]]'', a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The popular markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the ''[[Mercat de m&#xFA;sica viva de Vic]] &amp; [[Mercat Medieval]]''.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city's primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city is famous for its sausages and other [[pork]] derivatives, especially ''[[fuet]]'', a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==
[[File:Catedral de Sant Pere de Vic - 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Vic Cathedral]].]]
It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Ap&#xF2;stol or Sta. Maria la Rodona &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqueociencia.com/catedralvic.htm Sta. Maria la Rodona archaeological site and history]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop [[Jordi (bishop of Vic)|Jordi]] (915&#x2013;38) reconsecrated the Church of [[Ripoll]] and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d'Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a facade of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels that of St. Bernat Calv&#xF3; (1233&#x2013;43), who assisted [[James I of Aragon]] in the conquest of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic cloister is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of [[Pope Benedict XIV]], by Manuel Mu&#xF1;oz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet [[Jacint Verdaguer]], author of "[[L'Atl&#xE0;ntida]]". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the [[Jesuits]] built near it.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.

Other celebrated natives of Vic include:
*[[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Saint [[Michael de Sanctis]]
*[[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], (1814&#x2013;1888), born in Vic, later [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marquis 1607&#x2013;1896"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Was Who in America, Historical Volume, 1607&#x2013;1896 | publisher = Marquis Who's Who | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2005, some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s in the [[Spanish Christmas Lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116074911/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/22/spain.lottery.ap/index.html  Spanish town wins big in lottery], CNN, December 22, 2005.

'''Vic''' ({{IPA-ca|&#x2C8;bik}}) is the capital of the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]], in the [[Barcelona Province (Spain)|Barcelona Province]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Vic's location, only 69&amp;nbsp;km far from Barcelona and 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Girona]], has made it one of the most important towns in central Catalonia.

==Geography==
It lies in the middle of a plain with itself name, Plain Vic equidistant from Barcelona and the Pyrenees.

     Altitude: 499 m
     Latitude: 41 &#xBA; 55 '49 "N
     Length: 002&#xBA; 15 '17 "E

It is famous for its persistent Fog in winter as a result of a persistent thermal inversion with lows temperatures up to -10 &#xB0; C and an absolute record of -24 &#xBA;. Episodes of cold and severe snowstorms are noticeable. In summer storms are very common investing the dry season typical of the mediterranean climate of coastal Catalonia. Fot that reason the natural vegetation includes the pubescent oak typical of the submediterranean climates of eastern France, Northern Italy and the Balkans.

==History==

Vic is of ancient origin. In past times it was called ''Ausa'' by the Romans.  Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there.  The [[Visigoths]] called it '''Ausona'''. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read "Vich," an old form of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish [[Marches]] that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called ''Vicus Ausonensis'' (''vicus'' is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by [[Wilfred the Hairy]] in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the [[episcopal see]]. From then on, the city was ruled by the [[count of Barcelona]] and by the [[bishop of Vic]].

At a council in [[Toulouges]] in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first [[Peace and Truce of God]] that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King [[Philip V of Spain]]. The conflict became the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted [[Roller Hockey]] events of the Barcelona [[1992 Summer Olympics]].

==Ecclesiastical history==
{{main|Roman Catholic Diocese of Vic}}
The bishopric is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Tarragona]], bounded on the north by [[Girona]], on the east by Girona and [[Barcelona]], on the south by Barcelona and [[Tarragona]], on the west by Tarragona and [[Lleida]]. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained to any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip II]] granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The greatest glory of Vic of modern times is [[Jaume Balmes]], the foremost Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, whose remains are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress.
