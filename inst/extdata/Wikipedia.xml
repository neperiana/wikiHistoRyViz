}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[portmanteau]] of '''''[[wiki]]'''''{{refn|group=notes|Wikis are a type of website. The word "wiki" itself is from the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] [[Wikt:wiki#Hawaiian|word for "quick"]].&lt;ref&gt;"Wiki" in the Hawaiian Dictionary, revised and enlarged edition, University of Hawaii Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;}} and [[encyclopedia|''encyclo'''pedia''''']]. Initially only in English, Wikipedia quickly became [[multilingual]] as it developed similar versions in [[WP:language|other language]]s, which differ in content and in editing practices. The [[English Wikipedia]] is now one of more than 200 Wikipedias and is the largest with {{srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia|over {{#expr:0.1*floor ({{NUMBEROFARTICLES:R}}/100000)}} million}} articles. As of February 2014, it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million [[unique visitor]]s each month.&lt;ref name="small screen" /&gt; Globally, Wikipedia had more than 19 million accounts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Common Knowledge?: An Ethnography of Wikipedia]] | publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] | author=Jemielniak, Dariusz | year=2014 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of which there were about 69,000 active editors as of November 2014.&lt;ref name="WikiStat" &gt;{{cite web|url= http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaZZ.htm#editor_activity_levels|title=Wikipedia Statistics &#x2013; Tables &#x2013; Active wikipedians|publisher=Stats.wikimedia.org|date=|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of Wikipedia cite a 2005 survey of Wikipedia published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' based on a comparison of 42 science articles with ''[[Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica]]'', which found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached ''Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica''{{'}}s.&lt;ref name="GilesJ2005Internet" /&gt; Critics argue [[Criticism of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias]].&lt;ref name=EdwinBlack/&gt; Wikipedia has been criticized for being a mixture of "truths, half truths, and some falsehoods",&lt;ref name=EdwinBlack/&gt; and subject to manipulation and [[spin (public relations)|spin]].&lt;ref name=Petrilli/&gt;
{{TOC limit|3}}

== Openness ==
[[File:History Comparison Example (Vector).png|thumb|left|Differences between versions of an article are highlighted as shown.]]
Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the [[procrastination]] principle (i.e. waiting for an issue to cause enough problems before taking measure to solve it) regarding the security of its content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zittrain|first=Jonathan|title=The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It&amp;nbsp;&#x2013; Chapter 6: The Lessons of Wikipedia|author-link=Jonathan Zittrain|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2008|url=http://yupnet.org/zittrain/archives/16|isbn=978-0-300-12487-3|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started almost entirely open&#x2014;anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would be published immediately. As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.

=== Restrictions ===
Over time, the English Wikipedia and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example, in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.&lt;ref&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Registration|Registration notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages are now "protected" to some degree.&lt;ref name="WP protection policy 1"&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Protection policy|Protection Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A frequently vandalized article can be ''[[Help:Semi-protection|semi-protected]]'', meaning that only certain editors are able to modify it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Help:Semi-protection|English Wikipedia's semi-protection policy]]&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only [[Administrators (Wikipedia)|administrators]] are able to make changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Full protection|English Wikipedia's full protection policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors. For example, the [[German Wikipedia]] maintains "stable versions" of articles,&lt;ref name="WP some sites stable versions 1"&gt;{{cite mailing list|first=P.|last=Birken|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikide-l/2008-December/021594.html|title=Bericht Gesichtete Versionen |mailinglist=Wikide-l|date=December 14, 2008|language=German|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=February 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced [[Wikipedia:Pending changes|the "pending changes" system]] in December 2012.&lt;ref name="BInsider pending changes intro 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/pending-changes-safeguard-on-wikipedia-2012-12|title=Wikipedia Has Figured Out A New Way To Stop Vandals In Their Tracks|work=Business Insider|author=William Henderson|date=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system, new users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are "subject to review from an established Wikipedia editor before publication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frewin |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/10312095 |title=Wikipedia unlocks divisive pages for editing |publisher=BBC News |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wikipedia editing interface.png|thumb|left|The editing interface of Wikipedia]]

=== Review of changes ===
Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. The "History" page of each article links to each revision.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Revisions with libelous content, criminal threats, or copyright infringements [[WP:Suppression|may be removed completely]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Torsten_Kleinz" /&gt; On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page. Anyone can view the [[Help:Recent changes|latest changes]] to articles, and anyone may maintain a [[Recent changes|"watchlist"]] of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes. "New pages patrol" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:New pages patrol]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low [[transaction cost]]s of participating in a [[wiki]] create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor "creative construction" over "creative destruction".&lt;ref name="FMonday collaborative effort 1"&gt;Andrea Ciffolilli, [http://firstmonday.org/article/view/1108/1028 "Phantom authority, self-selective recruitment and retention of members in virtual communities: The case of Wikipedia"], ''[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]'' December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vandalism ===
{{Main|Vandalism on Wikipedia}}

Any edit that changes content in a way that deliberately compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include insertion of obscenities and crude humor. Vandalism can also include advertising language and other types of [[Wikipedia:Spam|spam]].&lt;ref name="upenn link spamming 1"&gt;[http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1508&amp;context=cis_papers Link spamming Wikipedia for profit] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or use images disruptively.&lt;ref name="WP vandalism manipulation 1"&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Vandalism|Vandalism}}. ''Wikipedia''. Retrieved November 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Seigenthaler Sr. speaking.jpg|thumb|alt=White-haired elderly gentleman in suit and tie speaks at a podium.|American journalist [[John Seigenthaler]] (1927&#x2013;2014), subject of the [[Seigenthaler incident]]]]
Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from wiki articles; the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes.&lt;ref name="MIT_IBM_study" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CreatingDestroyingAndRestoringValue" /&gt; However, some vandalism takes much longer to repair.&lt;ref name="Seigenthaler" /&gt;

In the [[Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident]], an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure [[John Seigenthaler]] in May 2005. Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.&lt;ref name="Seigenthaler" /&gt; The article remained uncorrected for four months.&lt;ref name="Seigenthaler" /&gt; Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of ''[[USA Today]]'' and founder of the [[Freedom Forum]] [[First Amendment Center]] at [[Vanderbilt University]], called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales replied that he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.&lt;ref name="book The World is Flat 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Thomas L.|title=The World is Flat|year=2007|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]]|isbn=978-0-374-29278-2|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=17798|title=Founder shares cautionary tale of libel in cyberspace|first=Brian J.|last=Buchanan|publisher=archive.firstamendmentcenter.org|date=November 17, 2006|accessdate=November 17, 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121221140311/http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=17798|archivedate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as "a flawed and irresponsible research tool".&lt;ref name="Seigenthaler" /&gt; This incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of {{srlink|Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|biographical articles of living people}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Helm|first=Burt|title=Wikipedia: "A Work in Progress"|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2005-12-13/wikipedia-a-work-in-progress|newspaper=[[BusinessWeek]]|date=December 13, 2005|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;span id="Rules_and_laws_governing_content"&gt;Policies and laws&lt;/span&gt;{{anchor|Rules and laws governing content and editor behavior}} ==
:''See also: {{srlink|WP:Five pillars|Wikipedia:Five Pillars}}''

{{anchor|Censorship}}
Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, [[copyright]] laws) of the [[USA|United States]] and of the [[U.S. State|U.S. state]] of [[Virginia]], where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located. Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the {{srlink|WP:Five pillars|"five pillars"}} and in numerous {{srlink|Wikipedia:List of policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines}} intended to appropriately shape content. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines.&lt;ref name="pcworld who's behind WP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/index.php/id;1866322157;fp;2;fpid;2|title=Who's behind Wikipedia?|work=PC World|date=February 6, 2008|accessdate=February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editors can {{srlink|Wikipedia:Enforcement|enforce these rules}} by deleting or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.&lt;ref name="WP some sites stable versions 1" /&gt;

=== Content policies and guidelines{{anchor|Content policies}} ===
{{Main|Wikipedia:Content policies|Wikipedia:Content guidelines}}
According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is [[wikt:encyclopedic|encyclopedic]] and [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary|is not a dictionary entry]] or dictionary-like.&lt;ref name="WP content policy 1"&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|What Wikipedia is not}}. Retrieved April 1, 2010. "Wikipedia is not a dictionary, usage, or jargon guide."&lt;/ref&gt; A topic should also meet [[Notability in the English Wikipedia|Wikipedia's standards of "notability"]],&lt;ref name="WP notability guide 1"&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Notability|Notability}}. Retrieved February 13, 2008. "A topic is presumed to be notable if it has received significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject."&lt;/ref&gt; which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.&lt;ref name="NOR" /&gt; [[WP:No original research|It must not present original research]]. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a [[WP:Identifying reliable sources|reliable source]]. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.&lt;ref name="WP Verifiability policy 1"&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Verifiability|Verifiability}}. February 13, 2008. "Material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed to a reliable, published source."&lt;/ref&gt; This can at times lead to the removal of information that is valid.&lt;ref name="IHT WP valid info wrong removable 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Noam|title=For inclusive mission, Wikipedia is told that written word goes only so far|newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]]|page=18|date=August 9, 2011|url=http://news-business.vlex.com/vid/inclusive-mission-is-that-goes-far-425135170|via=vLex}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article.&lt;ref name="alternet WP unethical editing destroy's credibility 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/61365/?page=entire|title=Will Unethical Editing Destroy Wikipedia's Credibility?|author=Eric Haas|publisher=AlterNet|date=October 26, 2007|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as neutral point of view ([[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|NPOV]]).
&lt;!-- This section is correct but IMO superfluously obvious, except for the part on verifiability. Chealer 2014 --&gt;

== Governance ==
Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanger|first1=Larry|title=The Early History of Nupedia and Wikipedia: A Memoir|url=http://features.slashdot.org/story/05/04/18/164213/the-early-history-of-nupedia-and-wikipedia-a-memoir|website=Slashdot|publisher=Dice|date=April 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kostakis|first1=Vasilis|title=Identifying and understanding the problems of Wikipedia's peer governance: The case of inclusionists versus deletionists|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2613/2479|website=First Monday|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of ''administrators'' are allowed to modify any article, and an even smaller number of ''[[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrats]]'' can name new administrators.

An article is not considered to be owned by it's creator or any other editor and is not vetted by any recognized authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Ownership of articles|Ownership of articles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avoidance of a [[tragedy of the commons]] is attempted with the attention of individual Wikipedians.&lt;ref&gt;Avoiding Tragedy in the Wiki-Commons, by Andrew George, 12 Va. J.L. &amp; Tech. 8 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrators ===
Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with "[[Administrators (Wikipedia)|administrator]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Administrators}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David_Mehegan" /&gt; privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes, and try to prevent certain persons from editing. Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_conduct|title=Wikipedia:Administrators|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect|title=Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect|accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/3-charts-that-show-how-wikipedia-is-running-out-of-admins/259829|title=3 Charts That Show How Wikipedia Is Running Out of Admins|last=Meyer|first=Robinson|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=July 16, 2012|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dispute resolution ===
Wikipedians may dispute, for example by repeatedly making opposite changes to an article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Edit warring|"edit war"]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Dispute Resolution|Dispute Resolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC WP editorial warzone 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sys03-public.nbcnews.com/technology/wikipedia-editorial-warzone-says-study-838793|title=Wikipedia is editorial warzone, says study|author=Coldewey, Devin|publisher=[[NBC News]]|work=Technology|date=June 21, 2012|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Wikipedia has developed [[WP:Dispute resolution|documentation for editors about dispute resolution]]. In order to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at the [[Wikipedia:Village pump|Village Pump]], or initiate a [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment|request for comment]].

==== Arbitration Committee ====
{{Main|Arbitration Committee}}
The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,&lt;ref name="emory disputes handled 1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wikitruth through Wikiorder|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1354424|format=PDF|publisher=[[Emory University School of Law]]|work=Emory Law Journal|volume=59|issue=1|year=2009|page=181|author=Hoffman, David A., Mehra, Salil K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the &lt;!-- The committee may (directly) rule that a content change is inappropriate, but may NOT (directly) rule that a certain content is inappropriate. --&gt;content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|biased]]). Its remedies&lt;!-- Although a caution is no remedy, this is the language used in the reference. This could be quoted or changed. --&gt; include cautions and [[WP:Probation|probations]] (used in 63% of cases) and [[WP:BAN|banning editors from articles]] (43%), subject matters (23%) or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and [[anti-social behavior]]. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus&lt;!-- This needs to be clarified. Anti-consensus behavior appears to be defined mostly as "edit warring". --&gt; or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wikitruth through Wikiorder|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1354424|format=PDF|publisher=[[Emory University School of Law]]|work=[[Emory Law Journal]]|volume=59|issue=1|year=2009|pages=151&#x2013;210|author=Hoffman, David A., Mehra, Salil K.|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community ==
{{Main|Wikipedia community}}

[[File:Wikimania - the Wikimentary.webm|thumb|Video of the 2005 [[Wikimania]] (an annual conference for users of Wikipedia and other projects operated by the Wikimedia Foundation)]]

Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated "Talk" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/papers/wikipedia_coordination_final.pdf|format=PDF|author=[[Fernanda B.

[[File:Editing Hoxne Hoard at the British Museum.ogv|thumb|left|Wikipedians and [[British Museum]] curators collaborate on the article [[Hoxne Hoard]] in June 2010.]]
Wikipedia's community has been described as [[cult]]-like,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2005/dec/15/wikipedia.web20|title=Log on and join in, but beware the web cults|first=Charles|last=Arthur|date=December 15, 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although not always with entirely negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/internet/08/03/wikipedia/index.html|title=Wikipedia: The know-it-all Web site|first=Kristie|last=Lu Stout|publisher=CNN|date=August 4, 2003|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of [[credential]]s, has been referred to as "[[anti-elitism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Wikipedia Must Jettison Its Anti-Elitism|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/12/30/142458/25|work=[[Kuro5hin.org|Kuro5hin]], Op&#x2013;Ed|author=[[Larry Sanger]]|date=December 31, 2004|quote=There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups [...] that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry "censorship," attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedians sometimes award one another [[Wikipedia:Barnstars|virtual barnstars]] for good work. These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Articulations of wikiwork: uncovering valued work in Wikipedia through barnstars|author=T.

Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.&lt;ref name="user identification" /&gt; As Wikipedia grew, "Who writes Wikipedia?" became one of the questions frequently asked on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=5F2472BC3443736B94200AFDCECAC3C8?doi=10.1.1.212.8218|title=Power of the Few vs. Wisdom of the Crowd: Wikipedia and the Rise of the Bourgeoisie|publisher=[[Viktoria Institute]]|first=Aniket|last=Kittur|format=PDF|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Wales once argued that only "a community&amp;nbsp;... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore "much like any traditional organization".&lt;ref name="blodget"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/2009/1/who-the-hell-writes-wikipedia-anyway|title=Who The Hell Writes Wikipedia, Anyway?|first=Henry|last=Blodget|work=Business Insider|date=January 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a ''Slate'' magazine article reported that: "According to researchers in Palo Alto, 1 percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2184487|title=The Wisdom of the Chaperones|date=February 22, 2008|first=Chris|last=Wilson|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by [[Aaron Swartz]], who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia|title=Raw Thought: Who Writes Wikipedia?|first=Aaron|last=Swartz|date=September 4, 2006|accessdate=February 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Decline in participation since 2007}}
A report in August 2014 showed that Wikipedia had at least 80,000 editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Wikipedia+Scores+140000+in+Bitcoin+Donations+in+One+Week/article36378.htm|title=Wikipedia Scores $140,000 in Bitcoin Donations in One Week|first=Jason|last=Mick|publisher=Daily Tech|date=August 11, 2014|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Decline in participation since 2009|A significant decline in the number of English-language editors]] was reported in 2013 by Tom Simonite who stated: "The number of active editors on the English-language Wikipedia peaked in 2007 at more than 51,000 and has been declining ever since...(t)his past summer (2013) only 31,000 people could be considered active editors."&lt;ref name="Simonite-2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simonite |first=Tom |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/520446/the-decline-of-wikipedia/ |title=The Decline of Wikipedia |date=October 22, 2013 |journal=[[MIT Technology Review]] |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several attempts to explain this have been offered. One possible explanation is that some users become turned off by their experiences.&lt;ref name="users on WP scarred away 1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wikipedians Are Born, Not Made|author=Panciera, Katherine|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Supporting Group Work|pages=51, 59|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation, according to Eric Goldman, is found in editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk pages, implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to build a user page, learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a "baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references". Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia,&lt;ref name="labor squeeze on WP 1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wikipedia's Labor Squeeze and its Consequences|publisher=Journal on Telecommunications and High Technology Law|author=Goldman, Eric|volume=8|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation",&lt;ref name="legal edu and WP 1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wikipedia and the Future of Legal Education|author=Noveck, Beth Simone|publisher=Journal of Legal Education|volume=57|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the contribution histories of [[IP addresses]] cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.

A 2007 study by researchers from [[Dartmouth College]] found that "anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia [...] are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site".&lt;ref name="sciam good samaritans 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=good-samaritans-are-on-the-money|title=Wikipedia "Good Samaritans" Are on the Money|work=Scientific American|date=October 19, 2007|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that "(I)t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users... 524 people... And in fact the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits."&lt;ref name="blodget" /&gt; However, ''[[Business Insider]]'' editor and journalist [[Henry Blodget]] showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most content in Wikipedia (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by "outsiders", while most editing and formatting is done by "insiders".&lt;ref name="blodget" /&gt;

A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others.&lt;ref name="liebertonline view on WP users 1"&gt;Yair Amichai&#x2013;Hamburger, Naama Lamdan, Rinat Madiel, Tsahi Hayat, [http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cpb.2007.0225 Personality Characteristics of Wikipedia Members], ''CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior'', December 1, 2008, 11 (6): 679&#x2013;681; {{DOI|10.1089/cpb.2007.0225}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newscientist view on WP users 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126883.900-wikipedians-are-closed-and-disagreeable.html|title=Wikipedians are 'closed' and 'disagreeable'|work=New Scientist|accessdate=July 13, 2010}} {{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2009 study, there is "evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content".&lt;ref name="newscientist WP boom to bust 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Giles|first=Jim|title=After the boom, is Wikipedia heading for bust?|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17554-after-the-boom-is-wikipedia-heading-for-bust.html|work=New Scientist|date=August 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, various universities have hosted [[edit-a-thon]]s to encourage more women to participate in the Wikipedia community. In fall 2013, 15 colleges and universities, including Yale, Brown, and Pennsylvania State, offered college credit for students to "write feminist thinking" about technology into Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ocad-to-storm-wikipedia-this-fall-1.1412807|title=OCAD to 'Storm Wikipedia' this fall|work=CBC News|date=August 27, 2013|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] announced in a BBC interview the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]'s plans for "doubling down" on the issue of [[gender bias on Wikipedia]].

Software changes were left open to explore ways of increasing the appeal of Wikipedia to attract women readers to register as editors, and to increase {{Clarification needed span|text=the potential of existing editors to nominate more women administrators|date=September 2014}} to enhance the 'management' presence of women at Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=CommonKnowledge&gt;{{cite book |last=Jemielniak |first=Dariusz |year=2014 |title=Common Knowledge?

Since Wikipedia is based on the [[World Wide Web|Web]] and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the [[English Wikipedia|English edition]]). These differences may lead to some conflicts over [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]] (e.g. ''colour'' versus ''[[color]]'')&lt;ref name="WP spelling MOS 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=Wikipedia:Spelling|title=Spelling|work=Manual of Style|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; or points of view.&lt;ref name="WP countering bias 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias|title=Countering systemic bias|accessdate=May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as "neutral point of view", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not [[free content|licensed freely]] may be used under a claim of [[fair use]].&lt;ref name="WP meta fair use 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fair_use|title=Fair use|publisher=Meta-Wiki|accessdate=July 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP meta WP images 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Images_on_Wikipedia|title=Images on Wikipedia|accessdate=July 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBM visual WP 1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/papers/viegas_hicss_visual_wikipedia.pdf|format=PDF|author=Fernanda B.

They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others).&lt;ref name="WP metawiki maintenance 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org|title=Meta-Wiki|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,&lt;ref name="WP meta stats 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Statistics|title=Meta-Wiki Statistics|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=March 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.&lt;ref name="WP meta articles on all sites 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have|title=List of articles every Wikipedia should have|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=March 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. As for the rest, it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might only be available in English, even when they meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.

[[File:User - demography.svg|thumb|left|500 px|Estimation of contributions shares from different regions in the world to different Wikipedia editions]]

Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because fully automated translation of articles is disallowed.&lt;ref name="WP auto-translations rules 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=Wikipedia:Translations|title=Wikipedia: Translation|work=English Wikipedia|accessdate=February 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles available in more than one language may offer "[[interwiki links]]", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.

A study published by [[PLOS ONE]] in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from [[North America]] was 51% for the [[English Wikipedia]], and 25% for the [[simple English Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0030091|title=Circadian Patterns of Wikipedia Editorial Activity: A Demographic Analysis|date=January 17, 2012|publisher=[[PLOS ONE]]|author=Taha Yasseri, Robert Sumi, [[J&#xE1;nos Kert&#xE9;sz]]|accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wikimedia Foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the Global South to thirty-seven percent by 2015.&lt;ref name="WP global south demographic increase plan 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikimedia Foundation 2011&#x2013;12 Annual Plan|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/37/2011-12_Wikimedia_Foundation_Plan_FINAL_FOR_WEBSITE_.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 2014, ''The Economist'' in an article titled "The Future of Wikipedia" cited a trend analysis concerning data published by Wikimedia stating that: "The number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years."&lt;ref name="economist1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/news/international/21597959-popular-online-encyclopedia-must-work-out-what-next-wikipeaks |title=The future of Wikipedia: WikiPeaks? |publisher=The Economist |date=March 1, 2014 |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by ''The Economist'' as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). ''The Economist'' reported that the number of contributors with an average of five of more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The attrition rates for editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, were cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 editors which has dropped to 30,000 editors as of the start of 2014. At the quoted trend rate, the number of active editors in English Wikipedia has lost approximately 20,000 editors to attrition since 2007, and the documented trend rate indicates the loss of another 20,000 editors by 2021, down to 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia by 2021 if left unabated.&lt;ref name="economist1" /&gt; Given that the trend analysis published in ''The Economist'' presents the number of active editors for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as remaining relatively constant and successful in sustaining its numbers at approximately 42,000 active editors, the contrast has pointed to the effectiveness of Wikipedia in other languages to retain its active editors on a renewable and sustained basis.&lt;ref name="economist1" /&gt; No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English language Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lih.

[[File:Nupedia logo and wordmark.png|thumb|alt=Logo reading "Nupedia.com the free encyclopedia" in blue with large initial "N".|Wikipedia originally developed from another encyclopedia project, [[Nupedia]].]]

Wikipedia began as a complementary project for [[Nupedia]], a free online [[English language|English-language]] encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. Nupedia was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of [[Bomis]], a [[web portal]] company. Its main figures were the Bomis {{abbr|CEO|chief executive officer}} [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Larry Sanger]], [[Editing|editor-in-chief]] for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own Nupedia [[Open Content]] License, switching to the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] before Wikipedia's founding at the urging of [[Richard Stallman]].&lt;ref name="stallman1999" /&gt; Sanger and Wales founded Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyers" /&gt; While Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,&lt;ref name="SangerMemoir" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanger" /&gt; Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a [[wiki]] to reach that goal.&lt;ref name="WM foundation of WP 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2001-October/000671.html|title=Wikipedia-l: LinkBacks?|accessdate=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia [[electronic mailing list|mailing list]] to create a wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia.&lt;ref name="nupedia feeder from WP 1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Larry|last=Sanger|title=Let's Make a Wiki|date=January 10, 2001|publisher=Internet Archive|url=http://www.nupedia.com/pipermail/nupedia-l/2001-January/000676.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030414014355/http://www.nupedia.com/pipermail/nupedia-l/2001-January/000676.html|archivedate=April 14, 2003|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia was formally launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,&lt;ref name="WikipediaHome" /&gt; and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.&lt;ref name="SangerMemoir" /&gt; Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"&lt;ref name="NPOV" /&gt; was codified in its first months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.&lt;ref name="SangerMemoir" /&gt; Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.&lt;ref name="Seth-Finkelstein"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/25/wikipedia.internet |title=Read me first: Wikipedia isn't about human potential, whatever Wales says |author=Finkelstein, Seth |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=September 25, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, [[Slashdot]] postings, and [[web search engine]] indexing. On August 8, 2001, Wikipedia had over 8,000 articles.&lt;ref name="Wikipedia August 08, 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20010808121638/http://www.wikipedia.org/ |title=Wikipedia, August 8, 2001 |publisher=Web.archive.bibalex.org |date=August 8, 2001 |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 25, 2001, Wikipedia had over 13,000 articles.&lt;ref name="Wikipedia September 25, 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20011010233257/www.wikipedia.com/ |title=Wikipedia, September 25, 2001 |publisher=Web.archive.bibalex.org |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; And by the end of 2001 it had grown to approximately 20,000 articles and 18 language editions. It had reached 26 language editions by late 2002, 46 by the end of 2003, and 161 by the final days of 2004.&lt;ref name="WP early language stats 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=Wikipedia:Multilingual_statistics|title=Multilingual statistics|work=Wikipedia|date=March 30, 2005|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. [[English Wikipedia]] passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing even the 1408 [[Yongle Encyclopedia]], which had held the record for 600&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="EB_encyclopedia" /&gt;

Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the [[Spanish Wikipedia]] [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from Wikipedia to create the ''[[Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Espa&#xF1;ol|Enciclopedia Libre]]'' in February 2002.&lt;ref name="EL fears and start 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[long] Enciclopedia Libre: msg#00008&lt;/nowiki&gt;|url=http://osdir.com/ml/science.linguistics.wikipedia.international/2003-03/msg00008.html|work=Osdir|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These moves encouraged Wales to announce that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and to change Wikipedia's domain from ''wikipedia.com'' to ''wikipedia.org''.&lt;ref name="Shirky" /&gt;

Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.&lt;ref name="guardian WP user peak 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/aug/12/wikipedia-deletionist-inclusionist|title=Wikipedia approaches its limits|author=Bobbie Johnson|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=August 12, 2009|accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.&lt;ref name="WP growth modelling 1"&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Modelling_Wikipedia_extended_growth}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team at the [[Palo Alto Research Center]] attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.&lt;ref name="wikisym slowing growth 1"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.wikisym.org/ws2009/procfiles/p108-suh.pdf|title=The Singularity is Not Near: Slowing Growth of Wikipedia|year=2009|location=Orlando, Florida|conference=The International Symposium on Wikis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ''Hidden whilst in discussion on the talk page'': New or occasional editors have significantly higher rates of their edits reverted (removed) than an elite group of regular editors, colloquially known as "the [[cabal]]".

In November 2009, a researcher at the [[Rey Juan Carlos University]] in [[Madrid]] ([[Spain]]) found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.&lt;ref name="guardian editors leaving 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/nov/26/wikipedia-losing-disgruntled-editors|title=Wikipedia falling victim to a war of words|work=The Guardian|location=London|author=Jenny Kleeman|date=November 26, 2009|accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://libresoft.es/publications/thesis-jfelipe | title=Wikipedia: A quantitative analysis | format=PDF | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403172516/http://libresoft.es/publications/thesis-jfelipe | archivedate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Wall Street Journal'' cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.&lt;ref name="WSJ WP losing editors 1"&gt;Volunteers Log Off as Wikipedia Ages, The Wall Street Journal, November 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study.&lt;ref name="telegraph Wales WP not losing editors 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/wikipedia/6660646/Wikipedias-Jimmy-Wales-denies-site-is-losing-thousands-of-volunteer-editors.html|title=Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales denies site is 'losing' thousands of volunteer editors|first=Emma|last=Barnett|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=November 26, 2009|accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from "a little more than 36,000 writers" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011.&lt;ref name="wiki-women" /&gt; In the same interview, Wales also claimed the number of editors was "stable and sustainable," a claim which was questioned by MIT's ''[[Technology Review]]'' in a 2013 article titled "The Decline of Wikipedia."&lt;ref name="Simonite-2013"/&gt; In July 2012, ''[[the Atlantic]]'' reported that the number of administrators is also in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/3-charts-that-show-how-wikipedia-is-running-out-of-admins/259829|title=3 Charts That Show How Wikipedia Is Running Out of Admins|work=The Atlantic|date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November 25, 2013, issue of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, Katherine Ward stated "Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.

In 2006, the ''Wikipedia Watch'' criticism website listed dozens of examples of [[plagiarism]] in the English Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="wwplagiarism" /&gt;

=== Accuracy of content ===
{{Main|Reliability of Wikipedia}}

Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as ''[[Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica]]'' are carefully and deliberately written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Conversely, Wikipedia is often cited for factual inaccuracies and misrepresentations. However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica by the science journal ''Nature'' found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that "the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three."&lt;ref name="GilesJ2005Internet" /&gt; Reagle suggested that while the study reflects "a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors" in science articles, "Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects."&lt;ref&gt;Reagle, pp. 165-166.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings by ''Nature'' were disputed by ''Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica'',&lt;ref name="corporate.britannica.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nature.com britannica response 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/press_releases/Britannica_response.pdf?item|format=PDF|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica and Nature: a response|accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in response, ''Nature'' gave a rebuttal of the points raised by ''Britannica''.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite web|work=Nature|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/britannica/index.html |title=Nature's responses to Encyclopaedia Britannica|date=March 30, 2006|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the ''Nature'' effort, and suggested a "flawed study design" (in ''Nature''{{'}}s manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported [[confidence interval]]s), and a lack of study "statistical power" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; articles compared, vs &gt;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and &gt;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; set sizes for ''Britannica'' and the English Wikipedia, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;See author acknowledged comments in response to the citation of the ''Nature'' study, at ''PLoS One'', 2014, "Citation of fundamentally flawed ''Nature'' quality 'study' ", In response to T.

As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia "makes no guarantee of validity" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.&lt;ref name="WP general disclaimer 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=Wikipedia:General_disclaimer|title=Wikipedia:General disclaimer|publisher=English Wikipedia|accessdate=April 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have been raised by ''PC World'' in 2009 regarding the lack of [[accountability]] that results from users' anonymity,&lt;ref name="WikipediaWatch" /&gt; the insertion of false information,&lt;ref name="pcworld WP blunders 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Raphel|first=JR|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/170874/the_15_biggest_wikipedia_blunders.html|title=The 15 Biggest Wikipedia Blunders|work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|accessdate=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[vandalism]], and similar problems.

Economist [[Tyler Cowen]] wrote: "If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true, after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia." He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles and relevant information is omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites, and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.&lt;ref name="tnr experts vigilant in correcting WP 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/story.html?id=82eb5d70-13bd-4086-9ec0-cb0e9e8411b3|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080318103017/http://www.tnr.com/story.html?id=82eb5d70-13bd-4086-9ec0-cb0e9e8411b3|archivedate=March 18, 2008|title=Cooked Books|first=Tyler|last=Cowen|work=The New Republic|date=March 14, 2008|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.&lt;ref name="TNY reliability issues 1"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Stacy Schiff]]|date=July 31, 2006|title=Know It All|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.&lt;ref name="AcademiaAndWikipedia" /&gt; Editors of traditional [[reference work]]s such as the ''Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica'' have questioned the project's [[utility]] and status as an encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="McHenry_2004" /&gt;

Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet [[troll (Internet)|trolls]], [[Spam (electronic)|spammers]], and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="Torsten_Kleinz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="citizendium WP trolling issues 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Toward a New Compendium of Knowledge (longer version)|url=http://www.citizendium.org/essay.html|work=Citizendium|accessdate=October 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011230402/http://www.citizendium.org/essay.html|archive-date=October 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to [[Conflict of interest editing|paid advocacy editing]] and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article by Jeff Elder in ''The Wall Street Journal'' on June 16, 2014 to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;June 16, 2014, "Wikipedia Strengthens Rules Against Undisclosed Editing", By Jeff Elder, ''The Wall Street Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that: "Beginning Monday (from date of article), changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeathByWikipedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet politicians and WP 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6032713-7.html|title=Politicians notice Wikipedia|publisher=CNET|author=Kane, Margaret|date=January 30, 2006|accessdate=January 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc MS cash for WP edits 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16775981|title=Microsoft offers cash for Wikipedia edit|publisher=MSNBC|author=Bergstein, Brian|authorlink=Brian Bergstein|date=January 23, 2007|accessdate=February 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seeing Corporate Fingerprints" /&gt; These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by [[Stephen Colbert]] on ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.&lt;ref name="wikiality" /&gt;

In February 2007, an article in ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' newspaper reported that a few of the professors at [[Harvard University]] include Wikipedia in their [[syllabus|syllabi]], but that there is a split in their perception of using Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="thecrimson wiki debate"&gt;Child, Maxwell L., [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=517305 "Professors Split on Wiki Debate"], The Harvard Crimson, Monday, February 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, former president of the [[American Library Association]] [[Michael Gorman (librarian)|Michael Gorman]] condemned Wikipedia, along with [[Google]],&lt;ref name="stothart" /&gt; stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are "the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything".

A Harvard law textbook, ''Legal Research in a Nutshell'' (2011), cites Wikipedia as a "general source" that "can be a real boon" in "coming up to speed in the law governing a situation" and, "while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources".&lt;ref name="Nutshell in-depth resources"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Morris|title=Legal Research in a Nutshell|author2=Olson, Kent|year=2010|publisher=Thomson Reuters|location=St. Paul, Minnesota, USA|edition=10th|pages=32&#x2013;34|isbn=978-0-314-26408-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Medical information ====
{{anchor|Medical information}}
{{See also|Health information on Wikipedia}}
On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for ''The Atlantic'' magazine in an article titled "Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia", stated that
"Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information."&lt;ref name="Julie Beck 2014"&gt;Julie Beck. "Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia". ''The Atlantic'', March 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Dr. Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve [[Health information on Wikipedia|Wikipedia articles on health-related issues]], as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by Dr. [[James Heilman]] to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of peer review evaluated articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer review evaluation standards.&lt;ref name="Julie Beck 2014" /&gt; In a May 7, 2014 follow-up article in ''The Atlantic'' titled "Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text", Julie Beck quotes Wikiproject Medicine's Dr. James Heilman as stating: "Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Green |first=Emma |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/can-wikipedia-ever-be-a-definitive-medical-text/361822/ |title=Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text? - Julie Beck |publisher=The Atlantic |date=May 7, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck added that: "Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured.' Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than 1 percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com" /&gt;

=== Quality of writing ===
Because contributors usually rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry. [[Roy Rosenzweig]], a history professor, stated that ''American National Biography Online'' outperformed Wikipedia in terms of its "clear and engaging prose", which, he said, was an important aspect of good historical writing.&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig" /&gt; Contrasting Wikipedia's treatment of [[Abraham Lincoln]] to that of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] historian [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]] in ''American National Biography Online'', he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in Lincoln's life, but praised "McPherson's richer contextualization [...] his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln's voice [...] and [...] his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words." By contrast, he gives an example of Wikipedia's prose that he finds "both verbose and dull". Rosenzweig also criticized the "waffling&#x2014;encouraged by the npov policy&#x2014;[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history". By example, he quoted the conclusion of Wikipedia's article on [[William Clarke Quantrill]]. While generally praising the article, he pointed out its "waffling" conclusion: "Some historians [...] remember him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero."&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig" /&gt;

Other critics have made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia articles are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented: "Even when a Wikipedia entry is 100 per cent factually correct, and those facts have been carefully chosen, it all too often reads as if it has been translated from one language to another then into to a third, passing an illiterate translator at each stage."&lt;ref name="theregister Wales WP founder on quality 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/18/wikipedia_quality_problem/page2.html|title=Wikipedia founder admits to serious quality problems|author=Andrew Orlowski|work=The Register|date=October 18, 2005|accessdate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of articles on  [[cancer]] was undertaken in 2010 by Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center at [[Thomas Jefferson University]] limited to those Wikipedia articles which could be found in the ''Physician Data Query'' and excluding Wikipedia articles written at the "start" class or the "stub" class level. Lawrence found the articles accurate but not very readable, and thought that "Wikipedia's lack of readability (to non-college readers) may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing".&lt;ref name="upi accuracy 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100601114641.htm|title=Cancer information on Wikipedia is accurate, but not very readable, study finds|work=Science Daily|date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Economist'' argued that better-written articles tend to be more reliable: "inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information".&lt;ref name="economist incomplete info"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8820422?story_id=8820422|title=Fact or fiction?

=== Coverage of topics and systemic bias ===
{{See also|Notability in English Wikipedia}}

Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all [[human]] knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has [[terabyte]]s of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="WP advantages over trad media 1"&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:PAPER}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see [[deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia|deletionism and inclusionism]]).&lt;ref name="Economist disagreements not uncommon"&gt;{{cite news|title=The battle for Wikipedia's soul|url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10789354|work=The Economist|date=March 6, 2008|accessdate=March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph WP torn apart 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikipedia: an online encyclopedia torn apart|first=Ian|last=Douglas|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=November 10, 2007|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3354752/Wikipedia-an-online-encyclopedia-torn-apart.html|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic because [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not censored|Wikipedia is not censored]]. The policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of [[Online petition on Wikipedia Muhammad article|images of Muhammad]] in the [[English Wikipedia|English edition]] of its [[Muhammad]] article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the [[censorship of Wikipedia]] by national authorities in [[China]],&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref name="washington post state censorship 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/20/AR2010052005073.html|title=Pakistan blocks YouTube a day after shutdown of Facebook over Muhammad issue|first=Karin|last=Bruilliard|work=The Washington Post|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name="BBC child image censored 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikipedia child image censored|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7770456.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=December 8, 2008|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other countries.

A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field:&lt;ref name="Kittur2009" /&gt;

{{refend}}

These numbers refer only to the quantity of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones. Through its "[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Loves Libraries|Wikipedia Loves Libraries]]" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]] to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.&lt;ref name="NYT subjects and articles"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/theater/editing-wikipedia-at-the-new-york-public-library-for-the-performing-arts.html|title=Wikipedia's Deep Dive Into a Library Collection|last=Petrusich|first=Amanda|work=The New York Times|date=October 20, 2011|accessdate=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the [[University of Minnesota]] indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the People and Arts category, while males focus more on Geography and Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lam|first=Shyong|author2=Anuradha Uduwage|author3=Zhenhua Dong|author4=Shilad Sen|author5=David R. Musicant|author6=Loren Terveen|author7=John Riedl|title=WP: Clubhouse?

==== Coverage of topics and selection bias ====
Research conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute has shown that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven. [[Africa]] is most underrepresented.&lt;ref name="zerogeography places coverage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zerogeography.blogspot.com/2009/11/mapping-geographies-of-wikipedia.html|title=Mapping the Geographies of Wikipedia Content|work=Mark Graham Oxford Internet Institute|publisher=ZeroGeography|accessdate=November 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "selection bias" may arise when more words per article are devoted to one public figure than a rival public figure. Editors may dispute suspected biases and discuss controversial articles, sometimes at great length.

==== Systemic bias ====
When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics, there may arise a [[systemic bias]], such as non-opposite definitions for apparent antonyms. In 2011, Wales noted that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, which predominantly consists of young males with high education levels in the developed world ({{lang|la|{{dabbr|cf|confer}}}} previously).&lt;ref name="wiki-women"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikipedia seeks women to balance its 'geeky' editors|author=Kevin Rawlinson|newspaper=The Independent|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/wikipedia-seeks-women-to-balance-its-geeky-editors-2333605.html|date=August 8, 2011|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's ''Technology Review'' titled "The Decline of Wikipedia" discussed the effect of systemic bias and [[Criticism of Wikipedia#Excessive regulation|policy creep]] on the [[#Decline in participation since 2009|downward trend in the number of editors]].&lt;ref name="Simonite-2013" /&gt;

[[Criticism of Wikipedia#Systemic bias in coverage|Systemic bias on Wikipedia]] may follow that of culture generally, for example favouring certain ethnicities or majority religions.&lt;ref name="Quilter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1035&amp;context=laura_quilter|title=Systemic Bias in Wikipedia: What It Looks Like, and How to Deal with It|author=Quilter, Laura|publisher=University of Massachusetts &#x2013; Amherst|date=October 24, 2012|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may more specifically follow the biases of [[Internet culture]], inclining to being young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing. Biases of its own may include over-emphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events.&lt;ref name="Quilter" /&gt;

Taha Yasseri of the [[University of Oxford]], in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Edit Wars Reveal the 10 Most Controversial Topics on Wikipedia", MIT Technology Review, July 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2269392 |title=The Most Controversial Topics in Wikipedia: A Multilingual and Geographical Analysis by Taha Yasseri, Anselm Spoerri, Mark Graham, Janos Kertesz :: SSRN |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2269392 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date=May 23, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research examined the [[counterproductive work behavior]] of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or "undo" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting "reverting/reverted pairs" or "mutually reverting edit pairs." Such a "mutually reverting edit pair" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the "mutually reverting edit pairs." The results were tabulated for all language versions of Wikipedia, with the English Wikipedia three largest conflict rates applying to articles about (i) ''G.W. Bush'', (ii) ''Anarchism'' and (iii) ''Mohammad''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; By comparison, for German Wikipedia the three largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering (i) ''Croatia'', (ii) ''Scientology'' and (iii) ''9/11 Conspiracy Theories''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information of graphic content. Articles depicting arguably objectionable content (such as ''[[Feces]]'', ''[[Cadaver]]'', ''[[Human penis]]'', and ''[[Vulva]]'') contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.

The site also includes [[sexual content]] such as images and videos of [[masturbation]] and [[ejaculation]], [[Child nudity|photographs of nude children]], [[Zoophilia|illustrations of zoophilia]], and photos from [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] films in its articles.

The Wikipedia article about ''[[Virgin Killer]]'' &#x2013; a 1976 album from [[music of Germany|German]] [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[rock band|band]] [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] &#x2013; features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked [[prepubescent]] girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article ''[[Virgin Killer]]'' was blocked for four days by most [[Internet service provider]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] after it was reported by a member of the public as [[child pornography]],&lt;ref name="Register ISP censorship"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brit ISPs censor Wikipedia over 'child porn' album cover|first=Cade|last=Metz|work=[[The Register]]|date=December 7, 2008|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/07/brit_isps_censor_wikipedia|accessdate=May 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] (IWF), which issues a stop list to Internet service providers. IWF, a non-profit, non-government-affiliated organization, later criticized the inclusion of the picture as "distasteful".&lt;ref name="WP free speech debate"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikipedia Censorship Sparks Free Speech Debate|first=JR|last=Raphael|work=The Washington Post|date=December 10, 2008|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/08/AR2008120803188.html|accessdate=May 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on [[Wikimedia Commons]] contained child pornography, and were in violation of [[United States obscenity law|US federal obscenity law]].&lt;ref name="Inquirer child abuse allegations"&gt;{{cite news|last=Farrell|first=Nick|title=Wikipedia denies child abuse allegations: Co-founder grassed the outfit to the FBI|newspaper=The Inquirer|date=April 29, 2010|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1603521/wikipedia-denies-child-abuse-allegations|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to [[pedophilia]] and one about [[lolicon]], were not of real children, but said that they constituted "obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children", under the [[Child pornography laws in the United States#Section 1466A|PROTECT Act of 2003]].&lt;ref name="The Register-April" /&gt; That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are [[Obscenity#United States obscenity law|obscene under American law]].&lt;ref name="The Register-April" /&gt; Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.&lt;ref name="TET child porn accusations"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikipedia blasts co-founder's accusations of child porn on website|date=April 29, 2010|work=The Economic Times|location=India|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/infotech/internet/Wikipedia-blasts-co-founders-accusations-of-child-porn-on-website/articleshow/5871943.cms|accessdate=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wikimedia Foundation]] spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,&lt;ref name="AFP" /&gt; saying that Wikipedia did not have "material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it."&lt;ref name="AFP" /&gt; Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was "in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted".&lt;ref name="BBC News Wales cedes rights"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/10104946.stm|title=Wikimedia pornography row deepens as Wales cedes rights|publisher=BBC News|date=May 10, 2010|accessdate=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, including [[Wikipediocracy]], noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.&lt;ref name="XBIZ"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newswire.xbiz.com/view.php?id=169017|work=XBIZ.com|date=September 17, 2013|first=Lila|last=Gray|title=Wikipedia Gives Porn a Break |accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privacy ===
One [[privacy]] concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a "private citizen" rather than a "[[public figure]]" in the eyes of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew McStay, 2014, [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Privacy-Philosophy-Affective-Protocol-Formations/dp/143311898X Privacy and Philosophy: New Media and Affective Protocol], New York Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes name="texaspress libel issues 1"&gt;See [http://texaspress.com/index.php/publications/law-media/731-law-a-the-media-in-texas--libel-cases "Libel"] by David McHam for the legal distinction&lt;/ref&gt; It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in [[cyberspace]] and the right to be anonymous in [[real life]] ("[[meatspace]]"). A particular problem occurs in the case of an individual who is relatively unimportant and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against her or his wishes.

In January 2006, a German court ordered the [[German Wikipedia]] shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of [[Tron (hacker)|Boris Floricic]], aka "Tron", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated.&lt;ref name="heise Tron public issue 1"&gt;[http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Gericht-weist-einstweilige-Verfuegung-gegen-Wikimedia-Deutschland-ab-Update-173587.html Heise &#x2013; {{lang|de|Gericht weist einstweilige Verf&#xFC;gung gegen Wikimedia Deutschland ab}}&lt;nowiki&gt;[Update]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], by Torsten Kleinz, February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia has a "{{visible anchor|Volunteer Response Team}}" that uses the [[OTRS]] system to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IT Service Management Software|url=http://www.otrs.com/en/|publisher=OTRS.com|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
A group of Wikipedia editors may form a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject|WikiProject]] to focus their work on a specific topic area, using its associated discussion page to coordinate changes across multiple articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ayers | first = Phoebe | title = How Wikipedia Works | publisher = No Starch Press | location = San Francisco | year = 2008 | isbn = 1-59327-176-X |page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Might need to be expanded. --&gt;

=== Wikimedia Foundation and the Wikimedia chapters ===
{{Main|Wikimedia Foundation}}
[[File:Wikimedia Foundation RGB logo with text.svg|thumb|upright|[[Wikimedia Foundation]] logo]]

Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as [[Wiktionary]] and [[Wikibooks]]. The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.&lt;ref name="financialstatements"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/a/ac/FINAL_10_11From_KPMG.pdf|title=Wikimedia Foundation &#x2013; Financial Statements &#x2013; June 30, 2011 and 2010|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikimedia chapters, local associations of users and supporters of the Wikimedia projects also participate in the promotion, development, and funding of the project. The foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990 shows revenue of $39.7 million and expenses of almost $29 million, with assets of $37.2 million and liabilities of about $2.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/5/5c/Form_990_-_FY_12-13_-_Public.pdf | title=Wikimedia Foundation IRS Form 990 | accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named [[Lila Tretikov]] as its new executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/WMF_announces_new_ED_Lila_Tretikov |title=Press releases/WMF announces new ED Lila Tretikov |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wall Street Journal'' reported on May 1, 2014 that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, "Information, like air, wants to be free."&lt;ref name="Jeff Elder 2014"&gt;Jeff Elder, ''The Wall Street Journal'', May 1, 2014, "Wikipedia's New Chief: From Soviet Union to World's Sixth-Largest Site".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/business/media/open-source-software-specialist-selected-as-executive-director-of-wikipedia.html?_r=0|title=Media: Open-Source Software Specialist Selected as Executive Director of Wikipedia|author=Naom Cohen|date=May 1, 2014|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same ''Wall Street Journal'' article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia who "said Tretikov would address that issue ([[Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia|paid advocacy]]) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities, Walsh said."&lt;ref name="Jeff Elder 2014" /&gt;

=== Software operations and support ===
{{See also|MediaWiki}}

The operation of Wikipedia depends on [[MediaWiki]], a custom-made, [[free software|free]] and [[open source software|open source]] [[wiki software]] platform written in [[PHP]] and built upon the [[MySQL]] database system.&lt;ref name="nedworks database system"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nedworks.org/~mark/presentations/san/Wikimedia%20architecture.pdf|format=PDF|title=Wikimedia Architecture|author=Mark Bergman|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=June 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software incorporates programming features such as a [[Macro (computer science)|macro language]], [[variable (programming)|variables]], a [[transclusion]] system for [[Web template|templates]], and [[URL redirection]]. MediaWiki is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on [[UseModWiki]] written in [[Perl]] by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required [[CamelCase]] for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a [[PhpWiki|PHP wiki]] engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by [[Magnus Manske]]. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the [[Exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by [[Lee Daniel Crocker]].

Several MediaWiki extensions are installed&lt;ref name="WP extensions installed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Version|title=Version: Installed extensions}}. Retrieved August 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.

In April 2005, a [[Lucene]] extension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2005-04-18/Lucene_search|title=Lucene search: Internal search function returns to service|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|author=Michael Snow|accessdate=February 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2005-April/016297.html|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[Wikitech-l&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;#93; Lucene search|author=Brion Vibber|accessdate=February 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from [[MySQL]] to Lucene for searching. The site currently uses Lucene Search 2.1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Lucene-search|title=Extension:Lucene-search|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and based on Lucene library 2.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/branches/lucene-search-2.1/lib|title=mediawiki&amp;nbsp;&#x2013; Revision 55688: /branches/lucene-search-2.1/lib|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, [[VisualEditor]], was opened to public use.&lt;ref name="thenextwebve"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Next Web]]|url=http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/07/02/wikimedia-rolls-out-its-wysiwyg-visual-editor-for-logged-in-users-accessing-wikipedia-articles-in-english/ |title=Wikimedia rolls out WYSIWYG visual editor for logged-in users accessing Wikipedia articles in English |author=Emil Protalinski|date=July 2, 2013 |accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/wikipedia/10196578/Wikipedia-introduces-new-features-to-entice-editors.html|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|title=Wikipedia introduces new features to entice editors|author=Curtis, Sophie|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheEconomistVE"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/12/changes-wikipedia |title=Changes at Wikipedia: Seeing things |author= L.M. |date=December 13, 2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="softpedia-best"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Softpedia]]|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Wikipedia-s-New-VisualEditor-Is-the-Best-Update-in-Years-and-You-Can-Make-It-Better-365072.shtml |title=Wikipedia's New VisualEditor Is the Best Update in Years and You Can Make It Better |author=Lucian Parfeni|date=July 2, 2013 |accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as "slow and buggy".&lt;ref name="Orlowski, Andrew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/01/wikipedians_reject_wysiwyg_editor/|title=Wikipedians say no to Jimmy's 'buggy' WYSIWYG editor|author=Orlowski, Andrew|date=August 1, 2013|publisher=The Register|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature was turned off afterward.

=== Automated editing ===
Computer programs called [[Internet bot|bots]] have been used widely to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Bots|Wikipedia Bot Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meetbots"&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet the 'bots' that edit Wikipedia|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18892510|author=Daniel Nasaw|publisher=BBC News|date=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|author2=Arthur, Charles|title=Boot up: The Wikipedia vandalism police, Apple analysts, and more|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/jul/26/boot-up-wikipedia-apple|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 26, 2012|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One controversial contributor massively creating articles with his bot was reported to create up to ten thousand articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/articles/for-this-author-10-000-wikipedia-articles-is-a-good-days-work-1405305001|title=For This Author, 10,000 Wikipedia Articles Is a Good Day's Work|last=Jervell|first=Ellen Emmerentze|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 13, 2014|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some bots designed to automatically warn editors making common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parenthesis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2009-03-23/Abuse_Filter|title=Wikipedia signpost: Abuse Filter is enabled|publisher=English Wikipedia|date=March 23, 2009|accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--and prevent the creation of links to particular websites. Bots also find and revert changes by suspicious new accounts, enforce bans against shared [[IP address]]es or the use of [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppets]] by a banned person operating from an alternate IP address.(unsourced/unverifiable)--&gt; Edits misidentified by a bot as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. [[User:ClueBot NG|An anti-vandal bot]] tries to detect and revert vandalism quickly and automatically.&lt;ref name="meetbots" /&gt; Bots can also report edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as was done at the time of the MH17 jet downing incident in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Aljazeera, July 21, 2014, "MH17 Wikipedia entry edited from Russian Government IP Address". [http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201407211855-0023944]&lt;/ref&gt; Bots on Wikipedia must be approved prior to activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Bot policy|Wikipedia's policy on bots}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Andrew Lih]], the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lih (2009). ''[[The Wikipedia Revolution]]'', chapter ''Then came the Bots'', pp. 99-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wikiprojects, and assessment of importance and quality ===
&lt;!-- BEGIN DUPLICATION WITH ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE.
Last synchronized 16 March 2015 --&gt;

A "[[Wikipedia:Wikiproject|WikiProject]]" is a [[social group|group]] of contributors who want to work together as a [[team]] to improve Wikipedia. These groups often focus on a specific topic area (for example, [[women's history]]), a specific location or a specific kind of task (for example, checking newly created pages). The English Wikipedia currently has over [[Wikipedia:Database reports/WikiProjects by changes|2,000 WikiProjects]] and activity varies.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject | title=Wikipedia: Wikiprojects | accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the [[English Wikipedia]] introduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles.&lt;ref name="WP 1.0 editorial team 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Assessment|title=Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment|accessdate=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles are rated by Wikiprojects. The range of quality classes begins with "Stub" (very short pages), followed by "Start", "C" and "B" (in increasing order of quality). Community peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality classes: either "A", "[[WP:Good articles|good article]]" or the highest, "[[WP:Featured articles|featured article]]". Of the about 4.4 million articles and lists assessed as of March 2015, a little more than 5000 (0.12%) are featured articles, and a little less than 2000 (0.04%) are featured lists. One featured article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the [[main page]] of Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="FMonday feat article patterns 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2365/2182|title=Comparing featured article groups and revision patterns correlations in Wikipedia|publisher=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]|accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBM feat articles hidden pattern 1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/papers/hidden_order_wikipedia.pdf|author=Fernanda B. Vi&#xE9;gas, Martin Wattenberg, and Matthew M. McKeon|title=The Hidden Order of Wikipedia|publisher=Visual Communication Lab, IBM Research|date=July 22, 2007|format=PDF|accessdate=October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive work of a few editors.&lt;ref name="Poderi Giacomo feat articles 1"&gt;Poderi, Giacomo, ''Wikipedia and the Featured Articles: How a Technological System Can Produce Best Quality Articles'', Master thesis, [[University of Maastricht]], October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study found unevenness in quality among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffective in assessing the quality of articles.&lt;ref name="FMonday WP quality control 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/2721/2482|title=Evaluating quality control of Wikipedia's featured articles|author=David Lindsey|publisher=First Monday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles can also be rated as per "importance" as judged by a Wikiproject. Currently, there are 5 importance categories: "low", "mid", "high", "top", and "???" for unclassified/unsure level. For a particular article, different Wikiprojects may assign different importance levels.

The [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team|Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team]] has developed a table (shown below) that displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance, on the [[English Wikipedia]]. ''If an article receives different ratings by two or more Wikiprojects, then the highest rating is used in the table.'' The software regularly auto-updates the data.

=== Hardware operations and support ===
{{see also|Wikimedia Foundation#Hardware}}
Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000 page requests per second, depending on time of day.&lt;ref name="WP tools requests per day"&gt;[[tools:~leon/stats/reqstats/reqstats-monthly.png|"Monthly request statistics"]], Wikimedia. Retrieved October 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of [[Squid (software)|Squid]] caching servers.&lt;ref name="site internals configuration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domasmituzas.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/mysqluc2007-wikipedia-workbook.pdf |format=PDF|title=Wikipedia: Site internals, configuration, code examples and management issues|author=Domas Mituzas|publisher=MySQL Users Conference 2007|accessdate=June 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further statistics, based on a publicly available 3-month Wikipedia access trace, are available.&lt;ref name="globule access trace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globule.org/publi/WWADH_comnet2009.html|title=Wikipedia Workload Analysis for Decentralized Hosting|author=Guido Urdaneta, Guillaume Pierre and Maarten van Steen|publisher=Elsevier Computer Networks 53 (11), pp. 1830&#x2013;1845, June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requests that cannot be served from the Squid cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the [[Linux Virtual Server]] software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.

=== Internal research and operational development ===
In accordance with growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported,&lt;ref&gt;Simonite, T. (2013). MIT ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of [[industrial organization]] economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Frederic M. Scherer and David Ross, [1970] 1990. ''Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance'', 3rd ed. Houghton-Mifflin. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1496716 Description] and 1st ed. review [http://www.jstor.org/pss/3003013 extract].&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#x2022; [[Google Scholar]] search of [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Frederic+M.+Scherer&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=1%2C47&amp;as_sdtp=on Frederic M. Scherer].&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and a largely under-utilized "Thank" tab which were developed for the purpose of ameliorating issues of editor attrition, which have met with limited success.&lt;ref name="Orlowski, Andrew" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simonite, T. (2013) MIT ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.&lt;ref name="Patents, Citations pp 89-153"&gt;''Patents, Citations, and Innovations'', by Adam B. Jaffe, Manuel Trajtenberg, pp 89-153.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe and Caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually.&lt;ref name="Patents, Citations pp 89-153" /&gt;

According to the Michael [[Porter five forces analysis]] framework for industry analysis, Wikipedia and its parent institution Wikimedia are known as "first movers" and "radical innovators" in the services provided and supported by an open-source, on-line encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="Porter, M.E. 1985"&gt;Porter, M.E. (1985) Competitive Advantage, Free Press, New York, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The "five forces" are centered around the issue of "competitive rivalry" within the encyclopedia industry where Wikipedia is seen as having redefined by its "radical innovation" the parameters of effectiveness applied to conventional encyclopedia publication. This is the first force of Porter's five forces analysis.&lt;ref name="Porter, M.E. 1980"&gt;Porter, M.E. (1980) Competitive Strategy, Free Press, New York, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The second force is the "threat of new entrants" with competitive services and products possibly arising on the internet or the web. As a "first mover", Wikipedia has largely eluded the emergence of a [[fast second]] to challenge its radical innovation and its standing as the central provider of the services which it offers through the World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;Markides, Constantinos (2005). Fast Second, Wiley&amp;Sons Inc., San Francisco, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Porter's third force is the "threat of substitute products" and it is too early to identify Google's "Knowledge Graphs" as an effective competitor given the current dependence of "Knowledge Graphs" upon Wikipedia's free access to its open-source services.&lt;ref name="Porter, M.E. 1985" /&gt; The fourth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is the "bargaining power of consumers" who use the services provided by Wikipedia, which has historically largely been nullified by the Wikipedia founding principle of an open invitation to expand and edit its content expressed in its moniker of being "the encyclopedia which anyone can edit."&lt;ref name="Porter, M.E. 1980" /&gt; The fifth force in the [[Porter five forces analysis]] is defined as the "bargaining power of suppliers", presently seen as the open domain of both the global internet as a whole and the resources of public libraries world-wide, and therefore it is not seen as a limiting factor in the immediate future of the further development of Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="Porter, M.E. 1985" /&gt;

=== Internal news publications ===
Community-produced news publications include the [[English Wikipedia]]'s [[WP:Signpost|''The Signpost'']], founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, an attorney, Wikipedia administrator and former chair of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] board of trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/05/technology/05wikipedia.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1|title=A Contributor to Wikipedia Has His Fictional Side|first=Noam|last=Cohen|work=The New York Times|date=March 5, 2007|accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from other [[Wikimedia project]]s, such as [[Wikimedia Commons]]. Similar publications are the German-language [[:de:WP:Kurier|''Kurier'']], and the Portuguese-language [[:pt:wp:Correio da Wikip&#xE9;dia|''Correio da Wikip&#xE9;dia'']]. Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the "Wikiworld" web comic, the [[WP:Wikipedia Weekly|''Wikipedia Weekly'']] podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like [[Wikipedia:BUGLE|''The Bugle'']] from [[WP:Milhist|WikiProject Military History]] and the monthly newsletter from [[WP:GOCE|The Guild of Copy Editors]]. There are also a number of publications from the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the [http://blog.wikimedia.org Wikimedia Blog] and ''[[:outreach:This Month in Education|This Month in Education]]''.

== Access to content ==

=== Content licensing ===
When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL), a [[copyleft]] license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.&lt;ref name="WP copyright and commerciality 1"&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with [[free software]] programs licensed under the [[GPL]]. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the [[Creative Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.&lt;ref name="WPF switch to CC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update|title=Resolution:License update|year=2007|author=Walter Vermeir|publisher=Wikizine|accessdate=December 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.&lt;ref name="voteresult" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MW licensing QA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update/Questions_and_Answers|title=Licensing update/Questions and Answers|work=Wikimedia Meta|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=February 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW licensing timeline 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update/Timeline |title=Licensing_update/Timeline|work=Wikimedia Meta|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP blog license migration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/05/21/wikimedia-community-approves-license-migration|title=Wikimedia community approves license migration|work=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]). Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.&lt;ref name="NYT photos on WP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/20funny.html|title=Wikipedia May Be a Font of Facts, but It's a Desert for Photos|date=July 19, 2009|last=Cohen|first=Noam|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia. This position has been successfully defended in court.&lt;ref name="reuters French defamation case"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSL0280486220071102?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=internetNews|title=Wikipedia cleared in French defamation case|agency=Reuters|date=November 2, 2007|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars tech WP dumb suing case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080502-dumb-idea-suing-wikipedia-for-calling-you-dumb.html|title=Dumb idea: suing Wikipedia for calling you "dumb"|first=Nate|last=Anderson|publisher=Ars Technica|date=May 2, 2008|accessdate=May 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods of access ===
Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside of the Wikipedia website.
* '''Websites''' &#x2013; Thousands of "[[mirror website|mirror sites]]" exist that republish content from Wikipedia: two prominent ones, that also include content from other reference sources, are [[Reference.com]] and [[Answers.com]]. Another example is [[Wapedia]], which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.
* '''Mobile apps''' &#x2013; A variety of mobile apps provide access to Wikipedia on [[hand-held device]]s, including both [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] devices (see [[Wikipedia App|Wikipedia apps]]). (See also [[#Mobile access|Mobile access]].)
* '''Search engines''' &#x2013; Some [[web search engine]]s make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include [[Bing]] (via technology gained from [[Powerset (company)|Powerset]])&lt;ref name="bing WP research and referencing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2009/07/27/researching-with-bing-reference.aspxResearching|title=With Bing Reference|publisher=|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DuckDuckGo]].
* '''Compact discs, DVDs''' &#x2013; Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on [[optical disc]]s. An English version, [[Wikipedia CD Selection|2006 Wikipedia CD Selection]], contained about 2,000 articles.&lt;ref name="wikipediaondvd authorized 1"&gt;[http://www.wikipediaondvd.com/ "Wikipedia on DVD"]. Linterweb. Retrieved June 1, 2007. "Linterweb is authorized to make a commercial use of the Wikipedia trademark restricted to the selling of the Encyclopedia CDs and DVDs".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wikipediaondvd commercially available 1"&gt;[http://www.wikipediaondvd.com/site.php?temp=buy "Wikipedia 0.5 Available on a CD-ROM"]. ''Wikipedia on DVD''. Linterweb. "The DVD or CD-ROM version 0.5 was commercially available for purchase." Retrieved June 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish-language version contains nearly 240,000 articles.&lt;ref name="WM polish WP on dvd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Polska_Wikipedia_na_DVD_%28z_Helionem%29/en|title=Polish Wikipedia on DVD|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are German- and Spanish-language versions as well.&lt;ref name="WP german on dvd 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=:de:Wikipedia:Wikipedia-Distribution |title=Wikipedia:DVD|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="python.org CDPedia Argentina 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://python.org.ar/pyar/Proyectos/CDPedia|title=CDPedia (Python Argentina)|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, "Wikipedia for Schools", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedians and [[SOS Children's Villages UK|SOS Children]], is a free, hand-checked, non-commercial selection from Wikipedia targeted around the [[National Curriculum (UK)|UK National Curriculum]] and intended to be useful for much of the English-speaking world.&lt;ref name="WP CD selection 1"&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Wikipedia CD Selection|Wikipedia CD Selection}}. Retrieved September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The project is available online; an equivalent print encyclopedia would require roughly 20 volumes.
* '''Books''' &#x2013; There are efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form.&lt;ref name="WP into books 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikipedia turned into book|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5549589/Wikipedia-turned-into-book.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jeCgQjpj|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=June 16, 2009|accessdate=September 8, 2009|archivedate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP schools selection 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schools-wikipedia.org|title=Wikipedia Selection for Schools|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, tens of thousands of [[print on demand]] books which reproduced English, German, Russian and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company [[Books LLC]] and by three [[Mauritius|Mauritian]] subsidiaries of the German publisher [[VDM Publishing|VDM]].&lt;ref name="FAZ" /&gt;
* '''Semantic Web''' &#x2013; The website [[DBpedia]], begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created the [[Wikidata]] project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available in a queriable [[Semantic Web|semantic]] format, [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]. This is still under development. As of Feb 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and 1,000 properties for describing them.

Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a [[web crawler]] is discouraged.&lt;ref name="WP DB usage policy 1"&gt;{{srlink|Wikipedia:Database download|Wikipedia policies}} on data download&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia publishes [[Wikipedia:Database download|"dumps"]] of its contents, but these are text-only; {{as of|2007|lc=y}} there was no dump available of Wikipedia's images.&lt;ref name="WP image data dumps 1"&gt;[[meta:Data dumps#Downloading Images|Data dumps: Downloading Images]], [[Wikimedia Meta-Wiki]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a [[WP:REFDESK|reference desk]], where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the [[Journal of Documentation]], the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard [[library reference desk]], with an accuracy of 55%.&lt;ref name="slis WP reference desk 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slis.indiana.edu/news/story.php?story_id=2064|title=Wikipedia Reference Desk|publisher=|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mobile access{{anchor|Wikipedia mobile access|Wikipedia mobile}} ====
{{See also|Help:Mobile access}}
[[File:Android 2.2 GT-I5800.png|thumb|The mobile version of the English Wikipedia's main page]]

Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard [[web browser]] through a fixed [[internet access|Internet connection]]. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the [[mobile web]] since July 2013, ''The New York Times'' on February 9, 2014 quoted Erik Moller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry.&lt;ref name="small screen" /&gt; The ''The New York Times'' article reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, "Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more."&lt;ref name="small screen" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' reports that Mr. Moller has assigned "a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile," out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by ''The New York Times'' for the "worry" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.&lt;ref name="small screen" /&gt;

''Bloomberg BusinessWeek'' reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market.&lt;ref&gt;Brad Stone, "How Google's Android chief, Sundar Pichai, became the most powerful man in mobile," June 30 &#x2013; July 6, 2014, ''Bloomberg BusinessWeek'', pp. 47-51.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with Sue Gardner in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The latest version of the Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014 to generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia&amp;hl=en |title=Wikipedia - Android Apps on Google Play |website=Play.Google.com |accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013 to similar reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia-mobile/id324715238?mt=8 |title=Wikipedia Mobile on the App Store on iTunes |website=iTunes.Apple.com |date=August 4, 2014 |accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the [[Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAP), via the [[Wapedia]] service. In June 2007 Wikipedia launched [http://en.mobile.wikipedia.org/ en.mobile.wikipedia.org], an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released,&lt;ref name="WM mobile added 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikimedia Mobile is Officially Launched|work=Wikimedia Technical Blog|url=http://techblog.wikimedia.org/2009/06/wikimedia-mobile-launch|date=June 30, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; located at [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/ en.m.wikipedia.org], which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based devices or [[WebOS]]-based devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged. Many devices and applications optimise or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia [[metadata]] (See {{srlink|Wikipedia:Metadata}}), such as [[geoinformation]].&lt;ref name="androgeoid.com LPOI WP 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://androgeoid.com/2011/04/local-points-of-interest-in-wikipedia|title=Local Points Of Interest In Wikipedia|date=May 15, 2011|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ilounge iphone gems WP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/15802|title=iPhone Gems: Wikipedia Apps|date=November 30, 2008|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikipedia Zero]] is an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Justin|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/01/wikipedia-plans-to-expand-mobile-access-around-the-globe-with-new-funding|title=Wikipedia plans to expand mobile access around the globe with new funding |publisher=Nieman Journalism Lab|website=NiemanLab|date=January 17, 2013|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

=== Readership ===
Wikipedia is extremely popular. In February 2014, ''The New York Times'' reported that Wikipedia is ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating "With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month [...] Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors."&lt;ref name="small screen" /&gt;

In addition to [[Logistic function|logistic growth]] in the number of its articles,&lt;ref name="modelling" /&gt; Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.&lt;ref name="comscore" /&gt; About 50% of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google,&lt;ref name="hitwisegoogle" /&gt; a good portion of which is related to academic research.&lt;ref name="hitwiseAcademic" /&gt; The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.&lt;ref name="365M" /&gt; The [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="Wikipedia users" /&gt; In 2011 ''Business Insider'' gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SAI |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/2011-digital-100#7-wikimedia-foundation-wikipedia-7 |title=The World's Most Valuable Startups |publisher=Business Insider |date=October 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to "Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47% of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_Readership_Survey_2011/Results |title=Research:Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011/Results &#x2013; Meta |publisher=Wikimedia |date=February 6, 2012 |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural significance ===
{{Main|Wikipedia in culture}}
&lt;!-- Every single cultural, media or Internet reference to Wikipedia does not need to be mentioned here and differentiation between what constitutes a matter of significance and what is run-of-the-mill is important when adding content here. --&gt;

Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.&lt;ref name="Wikipedia in media" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourgeois" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ssrn.com Wikipedian Justice 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1346311_code835394.pdf?abstractid=1346311|title=Wikipedian Justice|format=PDF|accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of Canada]]'s website refers to Wikipedia's article on [[same-sex marriage]] in the "related links" section of its "further reading" list for the [[Civil Marriage Act]].&lt;ref name="parl.gc.ca same-sex marriage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?billId=1585203&amp;View=10|title=LEGISinfo &#x2013; House Government Bill C-38 (38&#x2013;1)|publisher=|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]]&lt;ref name="WP_court_source" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&#x2013; though mainly for ''supporting information'' rather than information decisive to a case.&lt;ref name="Courts turn to Wikipedia" /&gt; Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some [[United States Intelligence Community|US intelligence agency]] reports.&lt;ref name="US Intelligence" /&gt; In December 2008, the scientific journal ''[[RNA Biology]]'' launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the [[Rfam|RNA family]] for publication in Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="Declan" /&gt;

Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,&lt;ref name="ajr.org WP in the newsroom"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikipedia in the Newsroom |url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4461|date=February&#x2013;March 2008|work=American Journalism Review|first=Donna|last=Shaw|accessdate=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twsY23" /&gt; often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="shizuoka plagiarized WP 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shizuoka newspaper plagiarized Wikipedia article|work=Japan News Review|date=July 5, 2007|url=http://www.japannewsreview.com/society/chubu/20070705page_id=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WA Express-News staffer resigns"&gt;{{Wayback |date=20071015045010 |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA010307.02A.richter.132c153.html |title="Express-News staffer resigns after plagiarism in column is discovered" }}, ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'', January 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="starbulletin.com Inquiry prompts dismissal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2006/01/13/news/story03.html|title=Inquiry prompts reporter's dismissal|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|author=Frank Bridgewater|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with [[YouTube]], [[Reddit]], [[MySpace]], and [[Facebook]]&lt;ref name="Time2006" /&gt;) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.

In July 2007 Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on [[BBC Radio 4]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/pip/efv21|title=Radio 4 documentary, BBC}}{{dead link|reason=Partially broken ("[an error occurred while processing this directive]"). Apparently impossible to verify.|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the word is one of a select band of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar ([[Google]], Facebook, YouTube) that they no longer need explanation and are on a par with such 20th-century words as [[The Hoover Company|hoovering]] or [[Coca-Cola]].

On September 28, 2007, [[Italy|Italian]] politician [[Franco Grillini]] raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of [[freedom of panorama]]. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, "the seventh most consulted website", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grillini.it/show.php?4885|title=Comunicato stampa.

On September 16, 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US election campaign]], saying: "Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day."&lt;ref name="WP.com WP election usage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/16/AR2007091601699_pf.html|title=On Wikipedia, Debating 2008 Hopefuls' Every Facet|author=Jose Antonio Vargas|work=The Washington Post|date=September 17, 2007|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An October 2007 [[Reuters]] article, titled "Wikipedia page the latest status symbol", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN2232893820071022?sp=true|title=Wikipedia page the latest status symbol|author=Jennifer Ablan|agency=Reuters|date=October 22, 2007|accessdate=October 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active participation also has an impact. Law students have been assigned to write Wikipedia articles as an exercise in clear and succinct writing for an uninitiated audience.&lt;ref name="LER students write for WP 1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Engaging with the World: Students of Comparative Law Write for Wikipedia|publisher=Legal Education Review|volume=19|issue=1 and 2|year=2009|pages=83&#x2013;98|author=Witzleb, Normann|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Awards ====
Wikipedia won two major awards in May 2004.&lt;ref name="WP awards for WP 1"&gt;[[m:Trophy box|"Trophy box"]], {{srlink|Wikipedia:Meta|Meta-Wiki}} (March 28, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual [[Prix Ars Electronica]] contest; this came with a &#x20AC;10,000 (&#xA3;6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in [[Austria]] later that year. The second was a Judges' [[Webby Award]] for the "community" category.&lt;ref name="webbyawards WP awards 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/winners-2004.php|title=Webby Awards 2004|publisher=The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences|year=2004|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110722174246/http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/winners-2004.php|archivedate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia was also nominated for a "Best Practices" Webby award.

In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15% of the votes in answer to the question "Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?"&lt;ref name="brandchannel.com awards 1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Anthony|last=Zumpano|title=Similar Search Results: Google Wins|url=http://www.brandchannel.com/features_effect.asp?pf_id=352|publisher=Interbrand|date=January 29, 2007|accessdate=January 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Wikipedia received [[Quadriga (award)|Quadriga]] ''A Mission of Enlightenment'' award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with [[Boris Tadi&#x107;]], [[Eckart H&#xF6;fling]], and [[Peter Gabriel]]. The award was presented to Wales by [[David Weinberger]].&lt;ref name="loomarea.com WP award 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loomarea.com/die_quadriga/e/index.php?title=Award_2008|title=Die Quadriga&amp;nbsp;&#x2013; Award 2008|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded the annual [[Erasmus Prize]], which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences.&lt;ref name="EP2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmusprijs.org/?lang=en&amp;page=Erasmusprijs|title=Erasmus Prize - Praemium Erasmianum|publisher=Praemium Erasmianum Foundation|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Satire ====
{{category see also|Parodies of Wikipedia}}
[[File:White Nerdy YOU SUCK cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=Wikipedia page on Atlantic Records being edited to read: "You suck!"|Wikipedia shown in [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s music video for his song "[[White &amp; Nerdy]]"]]

Many parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.

Comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' and coined the related term ''[[wikiality]]'', meaning "together we can create a reality that we all agree on&#x2014;the reality we just agreed on".&lt;ref name="wikiality" /&gt; Another example can be found in "Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence", a July 2006 front-page article in ''[[The Onion]]''.,&lt;ref name="onion WP 750 years 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/articles/wikipedia-celebrates-750-years-of-american-indepen,2007/ |title=Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years Of American Independence|accessdate=October 15, 2006|date=July 26, 2006|work=[[The Onion]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 2010 ''The Onion'' article "'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/articles/la-law-wikipedia-page-viewed-874-times-today,18521/ |title='L.A.

In an episode of the television comedy [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office U.S.]], which aired in April 2007, an incompetent office manager ([[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]]) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on [[negotiation]] tactics in order to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officetally.com/the-office-the-negotiation |title=The Office: The Negotiation, 3.19 |date=April 5, 2007 |accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tactics he used failed, as a joke about the unreliability of Wikipedia and what anyone can do to change its contents. Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2007-04-12-office-wikipedia_N.htm |title='Office' fans, inspired by Michael Scott, flock to edit Wikipedia |publisher=USA Today |date=April 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[My Number One Doctor]]", a 2007 episode of the television show ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which [[Perry Cox|Dr. Perry Cox]] reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the [[raw food diet]] reverses the effects of [[bone cancer]] by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the [[List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes|''Battlestar Galactica'' episode guide]].&lt;ref name="Bakken one doctor 1"&gt;Bakken, Janae. "[[My Number One Doctor]]"; ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''; [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]; December 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the comedic website ''[[CollegeHumor]]'' produced a video sketch named "Professor Wikipedia", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements.&lt;ref name="collegehumor.com WP funny 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegehumor.com/video/3581424/professor-wikipedia|title=Professor Wikipedia &#x2013; CollegeHumor Video|publisher=CollegeHumor|date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Dilbert]]'' comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying "Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia."&lt;ref name="dilbert WP funny 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2009-05-08|title=Dilbert comic strip for 05/08/2009 from the official Dilbert comic strips archive|publisher=Universal Uclick|date=May 8, 2009|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast a comedy series called ''[[Bigipedia]]'', which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.&lt;ref name="comedy.org.uk WP funny 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/bigipedia/interview/|title=Interview With Nick Doody and Matt Kirshen|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, comedian Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show, ''[[Tosh.0]]'', to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it at will. On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing.&lt;ref name="tosh CC WP funny 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tosh.comedycentral.com/blog/2010/02/03/your-wikipedia-entries|title=''Your Wikipedia Entries''|date=February 3, 2010|work=Tosh.0|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tosh CC WP funny 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tosh.comedycentral.com/video-clips/wikipedia-updates|title=''Wikipedia Updates''|date=February 3, 2010|work=Tosh.0|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2013, the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' [[website]] published a cartoon with this caption: "Dammit, [[Bradley Manning|Manning,]] have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/Dammit-Manning-have-you-considered-the-pronoun-war-that-this-is-going-t-Cartoon-Prints_i9813981_.htm |title=Manning/Wikipedia cartoon |accessdate=August 26, 2013 |author=Emily Flake |authorlink=Emily Flake |date=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sister projects &#x2013; Wikimedia ===
{{Main|Wikimedia project}}
Wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. These other [[Wikimedia projects]] include [[Wiktionary]], a dictionary project launched in December 2002,&lt;ref name="WM dictionary 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikimedia_News&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=4133|title=Announcement of Wiktionary's creation|publisher=meta.wikimedia.org|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wikiquote]], a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched, [[Wikibooks]], a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts, [[Wikimedia Commons]], a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia, [[Wikinews]], for citizen journalism, and [[Wikiversity]], a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.&lt;ref name="OurProjects" /&gt; Of these, only Commons has had success comparable to that of Wikipedia. Another sister project of Wikipedia, [[Wikispecies]], is a catalogue of species. In 2012 [[Wikivoyage]], an editable travel guide, and [[Wikidata]], an editable knowledge base, launched.

The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially the printed versions, e.g. ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]],'' which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bosman|first1=Julie|title=After 244 Years, Encyclopaedia Britannica Stops the Presses|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com//2012/03/13/after-244-years-encyclopaedia-britannica-stops-the-presses/|website=The New York Times|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmocrazed.com/2012/03/encyclopedia-britannica-dies-at-the-hands-of-wikipedia-infographic/ |title=''Encyclopedia Britannica Dies At The Hands Of Wikipedia'', Gizmocrazed.com (with ''statista'' infographic from NYTimes.com) |publisher=Gizmocrazed.com |date=March 20, 2012 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FT impact on traditional media"&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Caldwell|authorlink=Christopher Caldwell|date=June 14, 2013|title=A chapter in the Enlightenment closes|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae22314a-d383-11e2-b3ff-00144feab7de.html|publisher=[[Financial Times|ft.com]]|accessdate=June 15, 2013|quote=Bertelsmann did not resort to euphemism this week when it announced the end of the Brockhaus encyclopedia brand.

[...] What Germans like is Wikipedia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] wrote a 2005 essay, "The amorality of [[Web 2.0]]", that criticized websites with [[user-generated content]], like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers going out of business, because "free trumps quality all the time". Carr wrote: "Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening."&lt;ref name="RType WP traditional media impact 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=The amorality of Web 2.0|url=http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2005/10/the_amorality_o.php|date=October 3, 2005|work=Rough Type|accessdate=July 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. For instance, [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], the editor-in-chief of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]]'', wrote in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that the "[[wisdom of crowds]]" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top [[scientific journal]]s, with their rigorous [[peer review]] process.&lt;ref name="nature.com crowds wisdom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical solutions: Wisdom of the crowds|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/nature04992.html|work=Nature|accessdate=October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an ongoing debate about the influence of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business. "The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?" Said [[Kathryn Hughes]], professor of life writing at UEA and author of ''The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton'' and ''George Eliot: the Last Victorian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alison Flood |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2013/feb/07/traditional-biography-shakespeare-breakfast |title=Alison Flood: ''Should traditional biography be buried alongside Shakespeare's breakfast?'' |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific use ===
In [[computational linguistics]], [[information retrieval]] and [[natural language processing]], Wikipedia has seen widespread use as a [[text corpus|corpus]] for linguistic research. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the [[entity linking]] problem, which is then called "wikification",&lt;ref name="wikify"&gt;Rada Mihalcea and Andras Csomai (2007). [http://www.cs.unt.edu/~rada/papers/mihalcea.cikm07.pdf Wikify! Linking Documents to Encyclopedic Knowledge]. Proc. CIKM.&lt;/ref&gt; and to the related problem of [[word sense disambiguation]].&lt;ref name="milne witten WP usage 1"&gt;David Milne and Ian H. Witten (2008). Learning to link with Wikipedia. Proc. CIKM.&lt;/ref&gt; Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find "missing" links in Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="discovering missing WP links 1"&gt;Sisay Fissaha Adafre and [[Maarten de Rijke]] (2005). [http://staff.science.uva.nl/~mdr/Publications/Files/linkkdd2005.pdf Discovering missing links in Wikipedia]. Proc. LinkKDD.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from over 1&amp;nbsp;million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.&lt;ref name="Domesday Project" /&gt;

One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]], which was created by [[Douglas Adams]]. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative. [[Everything2]] was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges to public users.

[[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]], an encyclopedia which was not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia early in its history; however, it has been retired.&lt;ref name="stallman1999" /&gt;

Other websites centered on collaborative [[knowledge base]] development have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Espa&#xF1;ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]] are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as [[Encyclopedia of Life]] and the online wiki encyclopedias [[Scholarpedia]] and [[Citizendium]]. The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="Orlowski18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JayLyman" /&gt;

Interesting but sparse subjects are treated. While many readers may find parts interesting, it is long, in large part about the future (development), not presented with structure (long question period), somewhat outdated, and only an elite audience will understand all topics (certainly not a first-time reader of this article). Some topics: Visual editor (outdated), code review, wiki engines, MediaWiki's database model, MediaWiki's suitability for Wikimedia sites, AFD process, flagged revisions and proposed more advanced revision selection mechanisms, communication channels (mostly IRC / real-time).
